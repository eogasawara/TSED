	abstract = {Process mining enables the discovery of actionable insights from event data of organizations. Process analysis techniques typically focus on process executions at detailed, i.e., fine-grained levels, which might lead to missed insights. For instance, the relation between the waiting time of process instances and the current states of the process including resources workload is hidden at fine-grained level analysis. We propose an approach for coarse-grained diagnostics of processes while decreasing user dependency and ad hoc decisions compared to the current approaches. Our approach begins with the analysis of processes at fine-grained levels focusing on performance and compliance and proceeds with an automated translation of processes to the time series format, i.e., coarse-grained process logs. We exploit time series analysis techniques to uncover the underlying patterns and potential causes and effects in processes. The evaluation using real and synthetic event logs indicates the efficiency of our approach to discover overlooked insights at fine-grained levels.

State of the art time-series forecasting methods are either subject to concept drift on long-horizon forecasts, or fail to accurately predict coherent and accurate high-level aggregates. In this work, we present a novel probabilistic forecasting method that produces forecasts that are coherent in terms of base level and predicted aggregate statistics. We achieve the coherency between predicted base-level and aggregate statistics using a novel inference method based on KL-divergence that can be solved efficiently in closed form.

The stochastic nature and the variation concerning time in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals make it burdensome to investigate its characteristics. Being evolving in nature, it requires a dynamic predictive model. With the presence of concept drift, the model performance will get worse. Thus learning algorithms require an apt adaptive mechanism to accurately handle the drifting data streams. This paper proposes an inceptive approach, Corazon Concept Drift Detection Method (Corazon CDDM), to detect drifts and adapt to them in real-time in electrocardiogram signals.

	abstract = {Machine learning models are increasingly being used in predictive maintenance. However, due to the complexity of vibration and audio signals used in fault diagnosis, some pre-processing is required before feeding them into the machine learning algorithm. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Hilbert transform (HT) envelope spectrum are mostly used in the literature for pre-processing. However, these frequency domain transforms are not very effective when applied to rotating systems (e.g. bearings) fault detection. In this paper we propose to use signature coefficients to feed machine learning models for fault detection. Our experimental results show that this method outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on fault diagnosis data sets. Moreover, the results show that this method is particularly well suited for high dimensional time series. The results also show that compared to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the signature method requires fewer data points to detect failure. This means that in a situation where the two methods have similar performances, the signature method detects failure faster than FFT. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We present a one-class anomaly detection method that uses time series sensor data to detect anomalies or faults in semiconductor fabrication processes. Critically, this method is trained using only small amounts of known successful run data, making it possible to implement for many processes and recipes without needing example faults. The proposed method uses kernel density estimation (KDE) to create probability distributions for sensor values during nominal processing. When classifying unseen sensor data, we determine the likelihood that it arose from this (often non-Gaussian) nominal distribution, allowing us to classify new signals as nominal, or faulty. We present model extensions that enable adaptation to changes in the underlying process, i.e., concept drift, as well as transfer learning techniques that enable training of anomaly detectors for new process recipes with less data. The proposed methods are tested on historical data from plasma etch and ion implantation processes, outperforming benchmark methods including traditional statistical process control (SPC), one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), and variational auto-encoder (VAE) based detectors.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Predicting metrics associated with entities' transnational behavior within payment processing networks is essential for system monitoring. Multivariate time series, aggregated from the past transaction history, can provide valuable insights for such prediction. The general multivariate time series prediction problem has been well studied and applied across several domains, including manufacturing, medical, and entomology. However, new domain-related challenges associated with the data such as concept drift and multi-modality have surfaced in addition to the real-time requirements of handling the payment transaction data at scale. In this work, we study the problem of multivariate time series prediction for estimating transaction metrics associated with entities in the payment transaction database. We propose a model with five unique components to estimate the transaction metrics from multi-modality data. Four of these components capture interaction, temporal, scale, and shape perspectives, and the fifth component fuses these perspectives together. We also propose a hybrid offline/online training scheme to address concept drift in the data and fulfill the real-time requirements. Combining the estimation model with a graphical user interface, the prototype transaction metric estimation system has demonstrated its potential benefit as a tool for improving a payment processing company's system monitoring capability. © 2021 ACM.},

These observations differ from the expected behavior of the data set. In data streaming scenarios, it is possible to observe an increase in the speed of data generation in time series. Therefore, adapting to time series changes becomes crucial. Thus, identifying events associated with these changes is essential for timely and correct decision-making. Although there are many methods to detect events, it is still possible to have difficulties detecting them correctly, particularly those associated with concept drift. In order to fill the gap in the literature, this work proposes a new method, named Forward and Backward Inertial Anomaly Detector (FBIAD), for detecting events in time series. It contributes by analyzing surrounding inertia around observations. FBIAD outperformed other methods both in accuracy and elapsed time. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is one of the most important research contents in time series data analysis, which is widely used in many fields. In real world, the environment is usually dynamically changing, and the distribution of data changes over time, namely concept drift. The accuracy of static anomaly detection methods is bound to be reduced by concept drift. In addition, there is a sudden concept drift, which is manifested as a abrupt variation in a data point that changes the statistical properties of data. Such a point is called a change point, and it has very similar behavior to an anomaly. However, the existing methods cannot distinguish between anomaly and change point, so the existence of change point will affect the result of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to simultaneously detect anomaly and change point for time series with concept drift. The method is based on the fluctuation features of data and converts the original data into the rate of change of data. It not only solves the concept drift, but also effectively detects and distinguishes anomalies and change points. Experiments on both public and synthetic datasets show that compared with the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, our method is superior to most of the existing works and significantly superior to existing methods for change point detection. It fully demonstrates the superiority of our method in detecting anomalies and change points simultaneously. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Both complex and evolving nature of time series structure make forecasting among one of the most important and challenging tasks in time series analysis. Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Several approaches, ranging from simple and enhanced averaging tactics to applying meta-learning methods, have been proposed to learn how to combine individual models in an ensemble. However, finding the optimal strategy for ensemble aggregation remains an open research question, particularly, when the ensemble needs to be adapted in real time. In this paper, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning framework for learning linearly weighted ensembles as a meta-learning method. In this framework, the combination policy in ensembles is modelled as a sequential decision making process, and an actor-critic model aims at learning the optimal weights in a continuous action space. The policy is updated following a drift detection mechanism for tracking performance shifts of the ensemble model. An extensive empirical study on many real-world datasets demonstrates that our method achieves excellent or on par results in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches as well as several baselines. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the “Big Data” age, the amount and distribution of data have increased wildly and changed over time in various time-series-based tasks, e.g weather prediction, network intrusion detection. However, deep learning models may become outdated facing variable input data distribution, which is called concept drift. To address this problem, large number of samples are usually required to update deep learning models, which is impractical in many realistic applications. This challenge drives researchers to explore the effective ways to adapt deep learning models to concept drift. In this paper, we first mathematically describe the categories of concept drift including abrupt drift, gradual drift, recurrent drift, incremental drift. We then divide existing studies into two categories (i.e., model parameter updating and model structure updating), and analyze the pros and cons of representative methods in each category. Finally, we evaluate the performance of these methods, and point out the future directions of concept drift adaptation for deep learning. © 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

	abstract = {A model can be easily influenced by unseen factors in nonstationary environments and fail to fit dynamic data distribution. In a classification scenario, this is known as a concept drift. For instance, the shopping preference of customers may change after they move from one city to another. Therefore, a shopping website or application should alter recommendations based on its poorer predictions of such user patterns. In this article, we propose a novel approach called the multiscale drift detection test (MDDT) that efficiently localizes abrupt drift points when feature values fluctuate, meaning that the current model needs immediate adaption. MDDT is based on a resampling scheme and a paired student t-test. It applies a detection procedure on two different scales. Initially, the detection is performed on a broad scale to check if recently gathered drift indicators remain stationary. If a drift is claimed, a narrow scale detection is performed to trace the refined change time. This multiscale structure reduces the massive time of constantly checking and filters noises in drift indicators. Experiments are performed to compare the proposed method with several algorithms via synthetic and real-world datasets. The results indicate that it outperforms others when abrupt shift datasets are handled, and achieves the highest recall score in localizing drift points.  © 2019 IEEE.},

It incorporates a wide variety of data, for example, social media posts, online gamers in-game activities, mobile or web application logs, online e-commerce transactions, financial trading, or geospatial services. Accurate and efficient forecasting based on real-time data is a critical part of the operation in areas like energy utility consumption, healthcare, industrial production, supply chain, weather forecasting, financial trading, agriculture, etc. Statistical time series forecasting methods like Autoregression (AR), Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Vector Autoregression (VAR), face the challenge of concept drift in the streaming data, i.e., the properties of the stream may change over time. Another challenge is the efficiency of the system to update the Machine Learning (ML) models which are based on these algorithms to tackle the concept drift. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle both of these challenges. The challenge of adaptability is addressed by applying the Lambda architecture to forecast future state based on three approaches simultaneously: batch (historic) data-based prediction, streaming (real-time) data-based prediction, and hybrid prediction by combining the first two. To address the challenge of efficiency, we implement a distributed VAR algorithm on top of the Apache Spark big data platform. To evaluate our framework, we conducted experiments on streaming time series forecasting with four types of data sets of experiments: data without drift (no drift), data with gradual drift, data with abrupt drift and data with mixed drift. The experiments show the differences of our three forecasting approaches in terms of accuracy and adaptability. © 2020 IEEE.},

However, it has been suggested in the literature that this is not the best approach in changing environments due to the risk of data obsolescence. This paper proposes novel out-of-time cross-validation mechanisms for model selection and evaluation designed for binary classification. Our approach extends the reasoning behind the rolling forecasting origin method for time-series analysis, providing an effective methodology for obtaining the prequential performance of a classifier on an out-of-time test sample.

	abstract = {The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem has been extensively studied in order to address real-world challenges related to sequential decision making. In this setting, an agent selects the best action to be performed at time-step t, based on the past rewards received by the environment. This formulation implicitly assumes that the expected payoff for each action is kept stationary by the environment through time. Nevertheless, in many real-world applications this assumption does not hold and the agent has to face a non-stationary environment, that is, with a changing reward distribution. Thus, we present a new MAB algorithm, named f-Discounted-Sliding-Window Thompson Sampling (f-dsw TS), for non-stationary environments, that is, when the data streaming is affected by concept drift. The f-dsw TS algorithm is based on Thompson Sampling (TS) and exploits a discount factor on the reward history and an arm-related sliding window to contrast concept drift in non-stationary environments. We investigate how to combine these two sources of information, namely the discount factor and the sliding window, by means of an aggregation function f (.). In particular, we proposed a pessimistic (f = min), an optimistic (f = max), as well as an averaged (f = mean) version of the f-dsw TS algorithm. A rich set of numerical experiments is performed to evaluate the f-dsw TS algorithm compared to both stationary and non-stationary state-of-the-art TS baselines. We exploited synthetic environments (both randomly-generated and controlled) to test the MAB algorithms under different types of drift, that is, sudden/abrupt, incremental, gradual and increasing/decreasing drift. Furthermore, we adapt four real-world active learning tasks to our framework—a prediction task on crimes in the city of Baltimore, a classification task on insects species, a recommendation task on local web-news, and a time-series analysis on microbial organisms in the tropical air ecosystem. The f-dsw TS approach emerges as the best performing MAB algorithm. At least one of the versions of f-dsw TS performs better than the baselines in synthetic environments, proving the robustness of f-dsw TS under different concept drift types. Moreover, the pessimistic version (f = min) results as the most effective in all real-world tasks. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Nowadays the large volume of data from different sources especially as streaming data opens us various opportunities for streaming analytics. Concept drift is one of the challenging streaming analytic problems which observes the changes in the distribution of the data over time, and detecting and adapting these attracted many researchers. In this work, we modeled concept drift detection as a machine learning problem. We have followed a semi-supervised learning approach by utilizing a statistical test, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test which determines the variation of two time series distributions. The core work is to build a classifier that is capable of predicting the given window of data stream holds drift or not. As we have no labels representing drift or not drift for the stream windows, we have explicitly labeled some beginning parts of the stream using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and utilized these for building the classifier. Using this classifier, further, we can detect the drift. Also, we have used overlapping windows to avoid information loss. For building the classifier we have applied various classification models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Among them KNN model has a low false-positive rate and outperformed others with an accuracy 96%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the internet of things (IoT), high-dimensional time series data are generated continuously and recorded from different data sources; moreover, these time series are characterized by intrinsic changes known as concept drifts. Beside, decision-making in IoT applications may often involve multiple factors and criteria. Therefore, methods capable of handling high-dimensional non-stationary time series and many outputs are of great value in IoT applications. An important gap in the literature is the absence of fuzzy time series (FTS) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) methods. To fill this gap, we present a new methodology for forecasting high-dimensional non-stationary time series called MO-ENSFTS (multiple output embedding non-stationary fuzzy time series). MO-ENSFTS is a first-order MIMO multivariate model. We apply a combination of data embedding transformation and a non-stationary FTS model. We tested the proposed methodology on four real-world high-dimensional IoT time-series data sets. The proposed approach is a data-driven method, which is flexible and adaptable for many IoT applications. The computational results show that the proposed method outperforms recurrent neural networks, random forests and support vector regression methods, and is more parsimonious than deep learning methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, predicting its trend would significantly impact decision-making. However, this is not a straightforward task due to three main difficulties: temporal autocorrelation, spatial dependency, and concept drift caused by virus mutations and lockdown policies. Although machine learning has been extensively used in related work, no previous research has successfully addressed all three challenges simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel online multi-task regression algorithm that incorporates a chain structure to capture spatial dependency, the ADWIN drift detector to adapt to concept drift, and the lag time series feature to capture temporal autocorrelation. We conducted several comparative experiments based on the number of daily confirmed cases in 20 areas in California and affiliated cities. The results from our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is superior in adapting to concept drift in COVID-19 data and capturing spatial dependencies across various regions. This leads to a significant improvement in prediction accuracy when compared to existing state-of-the-art batch machine learning methods, such as N-Beats, DeepAR, TCN, and LSTM. © 2023},

	abstract = {Key Performance Indicators (KPI), which are essentially time series data, have been widely used to indicate the performance of telecom networks. Based on the given KPIs, a large set of anomaly detection algorithms have been deployed for detecting the unexpected network incidents. Generally, unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms gain more popularity than the supervised ones, due to the fact that labeling KPIs is extremely time- and resource-consuming, and error-prone. However, those unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often suffer from excessive false alarms, especially in the presence of concept drifts resulting from network re-configurations or maintenance. To tackle this challenge and improve the overall performance of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we propose to use active learning to introduce and benefit from the feedback of operators, who can verify the alarms (both false and true ones) and label the corresponding KPIs with reasonable effort. Specifically, we develop three query strategies to select the most informative and representative samples to label. We also develop an efficient method to update the weights of Isolation Forest and optimally adjust the decision threshold, so as to eventually improve the performance of detection model. The experiments with one public dataset and one proprietary dataset demonstrate that our active learning empowered anomaly detection pipeline could achieve performance gain, in terms of F1-score, more than 50% over the baseline algorithm. It also outperforms the existing active learning based methods by approximately 6%–10%, with significantly reduced budget (the ratio of samples to be labeled). © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The concept drift is a challenge in click fraud detection wherein frequent changes in the actual status label of publishers complicate the identification of publishers’ fraudulent behavior. However, using transfer learning by leveraging the knowledge from previously learned domains to newer domains can make these differences more accessible while saving training time and improving the model's performance. But the absence of other user-click datasets available publicly poses complexity in using transfer learning. Therefore, to use transfer learning towards predicting the publisher's conduct concerning change in their labels, this work aims to transform 1D user-click non-image features into a 2D graphical image. The work proposes a deep convolution neural network-based transfer learning (DCNNTr) framework that utilizes different pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models as powerful feature extractors that leverage prior learnings to avert learning from scratch. The robust features extracted by the feature extractors help identify the conduct of publishers and classify them as fraudulent or non-fraudulent from 2D graphical images using machine learning models. By leveraging the weighted layers in extracting features, DCNN models utilize their special properties of being computationally efficient and locally focused. We evaluated the designed model on the FDMA2012 user-click dataset using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Current work uniquely transforms the time series user-click non-image data into an image form. The experimental results demonstrate that features extracted with DenseNet121 followed by GTB have identified the fraudulent publishers with an average precision score of 79.8%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

We also aim for an effective and practical diagnosis of anomalies diagnosis to produce actionable intelligence that enables automated response. To achieve these objectives, we use the following approaches. (1) We model the status of the network by a stream of tensors where each tensor cell contains a time series. (2) We detect anomalous tensors at discrete time steps using an unsupervised tensor representation learning model. (3) We produce actionable intelligence through the diagnosis of anomaly detection results and by identifying the abnormal time series that are the most likely causes of each anomaly in the tensor. (4) We further analyze the traffic corresponding to each anomalous time series by an innovative method that extracts and isolates the attack traffic. (5) We provide solutions for challenges in streaming data anomaly detection such as large volume, high velocity, seasonality, and concept drift. We apply our approach to the complete test set of UGR data to show its practicality and effectiveness. Not only can we detect and isolate most of the labelled attack traffic, but we also identify many organic attack activities in the UGR data. Our results on the complete UGR dataset show high detection and isolation rate for the labelled attacks in the dataset. We also report on additional organic attacks we detected that were originally labelled as background in the dataset. Our analysis shows that the isolated background traffic represents interesting and potentially malicious behavior and can provide invaluable insight for cyber-threat researchers. Author},

	abstract = {In recent years, the availability of time series streaming information has been growing enormously. Learning from real-time data has been receiving increasingly more attention since the last decade. Online learning encounters the change in the distribution of data while extracting considerable information from data streams. Hidden data contexts, which are not known to the learning algorithms, are known as concept drift. Classifier classifies incoming instances using past training instances of the data stream. The accuracy of the classifier deteriorates because of the concept drift. The traditional classifiers are not expected to learn the patterns in a non-stationary distribution of data. For any real-time use, the classifier needs to detect the concept drift and adapts over time. In the real-time scenario, we have to deal with semi-supervised and unsupervised data, which provide no or fewer labeled data. The motivation behind this paper is to introduce a survey identified with a broad categorization of concept drift detectors with their key points, limitations, and advantages. Eventually, the article suggests research trends, research challenges, and future work. The adaptive mechanisms are also incorporated in this survey. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: The amount of data and behavior changes in society happens at a swift pace in this interconnected world. Consequently, machine learning algorithms lose accuracy because they do not know these new patterns. This change in the data pattern is known as concept drift. There exist many approaches for dealing with these drifts. Usually, these methods are costly to implement because they require (i) knowledge of drift detection algorithms, (ii) software engineering strategies, and (iii) continuous maintenance concerning new drifts. Results: This article proposes to create Driftage: a new framework using multi-agent systems to simplify the implementation of concept drift detectors considerably and divide concept drift detection responsibilities between agents, enhancing explainability of each part of drift detection. As a case study, we illustrate our strategy using a muscle activity monitor of electromyography. We show a reduction in the number of false-positive drifts detected, improving detection interpretability, and enabling concept drift detectors' interactivity with other knowledge bases. Conclusion: We conclude that using Driftage, arises a new paradigm to implement concept drift algorithms with multi-agent architecture that contributes to split drift detection responsability, algorithms interpretability and more dynamic algorithms adaptation. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

For most real-world applications such as nonstationary time-series data, concept drift often occurs in a cyclic fashion, and previously seen concepts will reappear, which supports a unique kind of concept drift known as recurring concepts. A cyclically drifting concept exhibits a tendency to return to previously visited states. Existing machine learning algorithms handle recurring concepts by retraining a learning model if concept is detected, leading to the loss of information if the concept was well learned by the learning model, and the concept will recur again in the next learning phase. A common remedy for most machine learning algorithms is to retain and reuse previously learned models, but the process is time-consuming and computationally prohibitive in nonstationary environments to appropriately select any optimal ensemble classifier capable of accurately adapting to recurring concepts. To learn streaming data, fast and accurate machine learning algorithms are needed for time-dependent applications. Most of the existing algorithms designed to handle concept drift do not take into account the presence of recurring concept drift. To accurately and efficiently handle recurring concepts with minimum computational overheads, we propose a novel and evolving ensemble method called Recurrent Adaptive Classifier Ensemble (RACE). The algorithm preserves an archive of previously learned models that are diverse and always trains both new and existing classifiers. The empirical experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world data stream benchmarks show that RACE significantly adapts to recurring concepts more accurately than some state-of-the-art ensemble classifiers based on classifier reuse.  © 2021 Tinofirei Museba et al.},

	abstract = {Recently, learning from continuously evolving streaming data attracts many researchers, especially when this data is inclined to change trends regularly (i.e. concept drift). Unluckily, conventional mining techniques and algorithms are proved inadequate to solve this problem, in which the model's performance degrades in stationary data, let alone in the case of data streams. Correspondingly, adjusting the model manually and constantly is ineffective, and with the current growth of the data size, it becomes impractical as well. However, automatic adaptive learning methods and algorithms could be a good solution, but they are seldom exploited in IoT business applications to address this issue. To that end, we aim to tackle the problem of concept drift occurs in time-series streaming data on IoT applications, in general, meteorology prediction, in specific. And taking into account the rapidly growing structure of fog-cloud computing, we attempt to leverage the powerful computation of the cloud layer as well as the closeness to IoT devices of the fog layer to design and implement a cooperative fog-cloud architecture in order to produce a faster and more accurate model. Our main objective is to obtain high performance and low latency, as these are the key requirements for real-time or nearly real-time data processing on IoT applications. The experimental findings have confirmed the study's hypothesis, where the adaptive model on the suggested cooperative fog-cloud architecture reduces both the error of prediction by 20% and the overall time for training the model by almost 41% compared to the baseline model. © 2021 IEEE.},

A notable problem that has been introduced by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments across the smart city ecosystem is that the statistical properties of data streams can change over time, resulting in poor prediction performance and ineffective decisions. While concept drift detection methods aim to patch this problem, emerging communication and sensing technologies are generating a massive amount of data, requiring distributed environments to perform computation tasks across smart city administrative domains. In this article, we implement and test a number of state-of-the-art active concept drift detection algorithms for time series analysis within a distributed environment.

	abstract = {The data collected by sensors is streaming data in the Internet of Things (IoT). Although existing deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods generally perform well on static data, they struggle to respond timely to streaming data after distribution changes. However, streaming data suffers from conceptual drift due to the highly dynamic nature of IoT. In network security, concept drift-oriented anomaly detection is a crucial task, because it can adjust the model to adapt to the latest data, and detect attacks in time. Existing streaming anomaly detection methods are confronted with some challenges, including the latency of model updates, the uneven importance of new data, and the self-poisoning due to model self-updates. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a knowledge distillation-based adaptive anomaly detection model toward concept drift, ADTCD. ADTCD transfers the knowledge of the teacher model to the student model and only updates the student model to reduce the delay. We construct an algorithm of dynamically adjusting model parameters, which dynamically adjusts model weights through local inference on new samples, in order to improve the model's responsiveness to new distribution data, meanwhile solving the problem of uneven importance of new data. In addition, we adopt a one-class support vector-based outlier removal method to tackle the self-poisoning problem. In comprehensive experiments on seven high-dimensional data sets, ADTCD achieves an AUC improvement of 12.46% compared to the state-of-the-art streaming anomaly detection methods. Our future direction will focus on exploring the concept-drift problem using methods beyond autoencoders. © 2014 IEEE.},

Although deep neural networks are the state-of-the-art for many machine learning tasks, their performance in real-time data streaming scenarios is a research area that has not yet been fully addressed. Nevertheless, much effort has been put into the adaption of complex deep learning (DL) models to streaming tasks by reducing the processing time. The design of the asynchronous dual-pipeline DL framework allows making predictions of incoming instances and updating the model simultaneously, using two separate layers. The aim of this work is to assess the performance of different types of DL architectures for data streaming classification using this framework. We evaluate models such as multi-layer perceptrons, recurrent, convolutional and temporal convolutional neural networks over several time series datasets that are simulated as streams at different speeds. In addition, we evaluate how the different architectures react to concept drifts typically found in evolving data streams. The obtained results indicate that convolutional architectures achieve a higher performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, but are also the most sensitive to concept drifts. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Data stream mining (DSM) represents a promising process to forecast financial time series exchange rate. Financial historical data generate several types of cyclical patterns that evolve, grow, decrease, and end up dying. Within historical data, we can notice long-term, seasonal, and irregular trends. All these changes make traditional static machine learning models not relevant to those study cases. The statistically unstable evolution of financial market behavior yields a progressive deterioration in any trained static model. Those models do not provide the required characteristics to evolve continuously and sustain good forecasting performance as the data distribution changes. Online learning without DSM mechanisms can also miss sudden or quick changes. In this paper, we propose a possible DSM methodology, trying to cope with that instability by implementing an incremental and adaptive strategy. The proposed algorithm includes the online Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm (SGD), whose weights are optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization Metaheuristic (PSO) to identify repetitive chart patterns in the FOREX historical data by forecasting the EUR/USD pair’s future values. The data trend change is detected using a statistical technique that studies if the received time series instances are stationary or not. Therefore, the sliding window size is minimized as changes are detected and maximized as the distribution becomes more stable. Results, though preliminary, show that the model prediction is better using flexible sliding windows that adapt according to the detected distribution changes using stationarity compared to learning using a fixed window size that does not incorporate any techniques for detecting and responding to pattern shifts. © 2023 by the authors.},

Machine learning techniques are used to obtain models to achieve a correct characterization of events as well as an accurate maliciousness measure. A model is constructed by setting up an effective collection of features that are able to characterize the maliciousness of IP addresses. As a first approach, a set of contextual features has been selected. These features are simple to extract and require no high costs. That set contains 23 features: 18 obtained through time series analysis, and the other 5 extracted directly related with the spatial (geolocation) and temporal (time of occurrence) similarity of the events. The test of the feature set is conducted with statistical analyses to determine which features are the most effective and the impact of hyperparameter selection in the construction of a time series of features. In addition, the effect of IP geo-localization shifts on model performance is studied through concept drift theory. The results conclude that, overall, the feature set provides adequate performance for our task, although more complex features may be required to achieve better performance.

	abstract = {Reliable prediction models facilitate performance monitoring and fault detection in geothermal power plants. With the measurements collected from power plants, data-driven models such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be trained learn the power plant dynamics and predict its performance. A common approach to apply RNN for prediction is to train a model offline using historical data. However, the dynamic relationship between measurements is not time-invariant due to maintenances and other variations in the system, such as changes in brine split between heat exchangers. As a result, using a pre-trained neural network for prediction can lead to poor performance under dynamically changing and non-stationary environments, and thus degrade the fault detection performance. To deal with this problem, we present a workflow that first detects changes in operating conditions from data using the dynamic inner canonical correlation analysis (DiCCA) and then adaptively updates a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder neural network model to learn the new dynamics. We apply the updated model to fault detection and demonstrate its performance using field data collected from a binary cycle geothermal power plant. © 2022 Geothermal Resources Council.

	abstract = {The behaviour of a dynamical system can be examined from time series using the technique of recurrence plots through visualization and quantification methods. One such method is the quadrant scan in which a recurrence plot of a time series is converted into a second time series whose local maxima can be identified and interpreted as possible transitions in dynamic behaviour. A recurrence plot can also be represented as a complex network. A quadrant scan can similarly be thought of as a partition of the network vertices into two communities. Here, we argue that different dynamic behavioural regimes can be realized as network communities and the quality of such partitions can be assessed using modularity. Thereby, community modularity can be used as an alternative to the quadrant scan. We investigate this correspondence with respect to two promising arenas for quadrant scan uptake, namely, concept drift detection from machine learning and tipping point or failure and damage monitoring in system maintenance. We also examine two additional data sets to highlight the potential of the methods.

	abstract = {Acoustic-based technologies have attracted more attention in indoor ranging-based localization and tracking applications. To achieve high-accuracy ranging measurements, the precise identification of line-of-sight (LOS) acoustic signals is essential. This article proposes a novel off-online dynamic training (OODT) method to identify LOS acoustic signals from stream perspective based on a few training data in dynamic indoor environment. The dynamic online training method is proposed to identify the unlabeled acoustic feature stream by the parent-child model, utilizing the dynamic prior probability from time series information and a selection strategy based on the prediction risk. Then, the trustworthy pseudo-labeled streaming samples are accumulated into the child-models by online learning in real time. To reduce the impact of discarding the untrustworthy LOS signals, the off-online retraining method is proposed to incorporate the spatial information into the parent-models, which uses the category distribution of all pseudo-labeled streaming samples as the prior probability for iterative retraining. Subsequently, a new round of the dynamic online training is conducted to update the pseudo-labels of feature stream. Experiments demonstrate that the dynamic online training method has a higher identification precision of LOS acoustic signals from stream perspective, reaching 98% and more than 93.06% in above-ground and underground experimental scenarios. Moreover, the adaption for the concept drift is also verified with identification precision of 97.98% and 98.23%, respectively. The off-online retraining method further optimize the performance of the parent-child models in a single scenario. In conclusion, the proposed OODT method can autonomously identify dynamic acoustic signals with strong robustness and scenario drift adaptability.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

Many online anomaly detection algorithms have been proposed in recent years. However, they are mainly designed to detect point anomalies, which fail to identify collective or contextual anomalies very well. Thus in this paper, we propose a framework of Collective Contextual Anomaly Detection (CCAD) for KPI data stream. Via Pearson correlation coefficient-based method to adapt to KPI stream, our framework addresses the limitation of time series discords algorithm and achieves a huge improvement in the accuracy for KPI stream. Moreover, instead of using a static threshold, we employ SPOT to generate an automatic threshold to determine anomalies. Extensive experimental results and analysis on multiple public KPIs show the competitive performance of CCAD and the significance of collective contextual anomalies. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Dealing with an unbounded data stream involves overcoming the assumption that data is identically distributed and independent. A data stream can, in fact, exhibit temporal dependencies (i.e., be a time series), and data can change distribution over time (concept drift). The two problems are deeply discussed, and existing solutions address them separately: a joint solution is absent. In addition, learning multiple concepts implies remembering the past (a.k.a. avoiding catastrophic forgetting in Neural Networks’ terminology). This work proposes Continuous Progressive Neural Networks (cPNN), a solution that tames concept drifts, handles temporal dependencies, and bypasses catastrophic forgetting. cPNN is a continuous version of Progressive Neural Networks, a methodology for remembering old concepts and transferring past knowledge to fit the new concepts quickly. We base our method on Recurrent Neural Networks and exploit the Stochastic Gradient Descent applied to data streams with temporal dependencies. Results of an ablation study show a quick adaptation of cPNN to new concepts and robustness to drifts. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, various sophisticated epidemic and machine learning models have been used for forecasting. These models, however, rely on carefully selected architectures and detailed data that is often only available for specific regions. Automated machine learning (AutoML) addresses these challenges by allowing to automatically create forecasting pipelines in a data-driven manner, resulting in high-quality predictions. In this paper, we study the role of open data along with AutoML systems in acquiring high-performance forecasting models for COVID-19. Here, we adapted the AutoML framework auto-sklearn to the time series forecasting task and introduced two variants for multi-step ahead COVID-19 forecasting, which we refer to as (a) multi-output and (b) repeated single output forecasting. We studied the usefulness of anonymised open mobility datasets (place visits and the use of different transportation modes) in addition to open mortality data. We evaluated three drift adaptation strategies to deal with concept drifts in data by (i) refitting our models on part of the data, (ii) the full data, or (iii) retraining the models completely. We compared the performance of our AutoML methods in terms of RMSE with five baselines on two testing periods (over 2020 and 2021). Our results show that combining mobility features and mortality data improves forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, we show that when faced with concept drifts, our method refitted on recent data using place visits mobility features outperforms all other approaches for 22 of the 26 countries considered in our study.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The development of seizure prediction models is often based on long-term scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) since they capture brain electrical activity, are non-invasive, and come at a relatively low-cost. However, they suffer from major shortcomings. First, long-term EEG is usually highly contaminated with artefacts. Second, changes in the EEG signal over long intervals, known as concept drift, are often neglected. We evaluate the influence of these problems on deep neural networks using EEG time series and on shallow neural networks using widely-used EEG features. Our patient-specific prediction models were tested in 1577 hours of continuous EEG, containing 91 seizures from 41 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who were undergoing pre-surgical monitoring. Our results showed that cleaning EEG data, using a previously developed artefact removal method based on deep convolutional neural networks, improved prediction performance. We also found that retraining the models over time reduced false predictions. Furthermore, the results show that although deep neural networks processing EEG time series are less susceptible to false alarms, they may need more data to surpass feature-based methods. These findings highlight the importance of robust data denoising and periodic adaptation of seizure prediction models. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging scenarios of data analysis is prediction using time series data. As the underlying causal relationships of the data shift over time, a classification model trained on data at earlier points within the course starts to yield incorrect predictions on the current data. This phenomenon in machine learning is called concept drift. Within biomedical data, one of the molecular networks that changes significantly over a time is the metabolome. Using metabolomics analysis in biomedical applications produces an ideal tool in preventive healthcare, the pharmaceutical industry, and even ecology engineering. This study provides an innovative perspective on the analysis of metabolomics datasets using the concept of drift detection. The evaluation is based on two main objectives. The first objective is connected to the concept drift detection in available metabolomics datasets, and the second objective is to provide the assessment of commonly used machine learning tools for the best general detection approach in metabolomics datasets. The application of concept drift to metabolomics data has never been carried out before and is an original take on the analysis of highly dynamic molecular networks.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is an essential task in practical applications, such as data monitoring and network security detection. A common approach for anomaly detection is to use sequential models. As an effective sequence model, Transformer can capture the long-term dependence of the time series and is expected to better complete anomaly detection tasks. However, there are still problems to be addressed when using Transformer for anomaly detection. (1) Failing to adapt to concept drift: The vanilla Transformer assumes that the training and test data come from the same distribution. However, practical situations may often violate this assumption due to the time-varying nature of time-series data that may lead to concept drift problems. (2) High computational complexity: The time complexity of vanilla Transformer in the inference stage increase quadratically with the sequence length L. To solve the first problem, we propose the concept drift adaptation method (CDAM), a kind of distribution adaptation method, to dynamic tuning the learning rate of Transformer. CDAM aims to fully utilize the old concept data to optimize a new model on the new concept data through an online learning strategy. To address the second problem, we propose the root square sparse self-attention, which requires only O(LL) time complexity. Experimental results on several anomaly detection benchmarks show that our model outperforms many anomaly detection methods, especially in time series with concept drift. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The MTS follows two dimensions, namely spatial along the different variables composing the MTS and temporal. Both, the complex and the time-evolving nature of MTS data make forecasting one of the most challenging tasks in time series analysis. Typical methods for MTS forecasting are designed to operate in a static manner in time or space without taking into account the evolution of spatio-temporal dependencies among data observations, which may be subject to significant changes. Moreover, it is generally accepted that none of these methods is universally valid for every application. Therefore, we propose an online adaptation of MTS forecasting by devising a fully automated framework for both adaptive input spatio-temporal variables and adequate forecasting model selection. The adaptation is performed in an informed manner following concept-drift detection in both spatio-temporal dependencies and model performance over time. In addition, a well-designed meta-learning scheme is used to automate the selection of appropriate dependence measures and the forecasting model. An extensive empirical study on several real-world datasets shows that our method achieves excellent or on-par results in comparison to the state-of-the-art (SoA) approaches as well as several baselines. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection solution that can deal with streaming data, called OOA-UADS (Offline, Online, Analysis-an Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Solution for Multivariate Time Series). The solution consists of three stages: offline training, online prediction and anomaly analysis. Time convolutional networks and variational autoencoders are used to deconstruct and reconstruct the multivariate time series data to learn the normal patterns. The anomaly inversion mechanism identifies concept drift in the anomaly prediction stage by dynamically updating the classification thresholds. Intelligent anomaly analysis then provides anomaly dimensions to help engineers better analyse the anomalous behaviour. Our experiments show that OOA-UADS performs satisfactorily. On seven streaming datasets, OOA-UADS outperforms 11 baselines in terms of AUC and provides state-of-the-art F1 scores on three batch datasets. © 2023 IEEE.},

Furthermore, hybrid recurring concept drifts occur due to repeated implementation of multiple control strategies, resulting in lower accuracies of time series prediction (TSP). This paper proposes an Online Autoregression with Deep Long-Short-Term Memory (OAR-DLSTM) method for the hybrid recurring concept drifts of process industry streaming data. According to the classification of recurring concepts, the prediction task is assigned to multiple independent prediction sub-models, in which the Deep Long Short Term Memory (DLSTM) method is introduced to acquire temporal correlation of nonlinear streaming data. Online Autoregression (OAR) is adopted to ensure TSP with more accurate results to address the overlap and transfer between different recurring concepts. The proposed method is applied to two data sets from a vertical roller mill system of a steel company in Jiangsu, China.

	abstract = {Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been rapidly increasing, resulting in low antibiotic effectiveness even treating common infections. The presence of resistant pathogens in environments such as a hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) exacerbates the critical admission-acquired infections. This work focuses on the prediction of antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial infections at the ICU, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural networks as the predictive method. The analyzed data were extracted from the Electronic Health Records (EHR) of patients admitted to the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada from 2004 to 2019 and were modeled as Multivariate Time Series. A data-driven dimensionality reduction method is built by adapting three feature importance techniques from the literature to the considered data and proposing an algorithm for selecting the most appropriate number of features. This is done using LSTM sequential capabilities so that the temporal aspect of features is taken into account. Furthermore, an ensemble of LSTMs is used to reduce the variance in performance. Our results indicate that the patient's admission information, the antibiotics administered during the ICU stay, and the previous antimicrobial resistance are the most important risk factors.

	abstract = {The existence of an anomaly detection method that is optimal for all domains is a myth. Thus, there exists a plethora of anomaly detection methods which increases every year for a wide variety of domains. But a strength can also be a weakness; given this massive library of methods, how can one select the best method for their application? Current literature is focused on creating new anomaly detection methods or large frameworks for experimenting with multiple methods at the same time. However, and especially as the literature continues to expand, an extensive evaluation of every anomaly detection method is simply not feasible. To reduce this evaluation burden, we present guidelines to intelligently choose the optimal anomaly detection methods based on the characteristics the time series displays such as seasonality, trend, level change concept drift, and missing time steps. We provide a comprehensive experimental validation and survey of twelve anomaly detection methods over different time series characteristics to form guidelines based on several metrics: the AUC (Area Under the Curve), windowed F-score, and Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) scoring model. Applying our methodologies can save time and effort by surfacing the most promising anomaly detection methods instead of experimenting extensively with a rapidly expanding library of anomaly detection methods, especially in an online setting. © 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

	abstract = {Automated Credit Scoring (ACS) is the process of predicting user credit based on historical data. It involves analyzing and predicting the association between the data and particular credit values based on similar data. Recently, ACS has been handled as a machine learning problem, and numerous models were developed to address it. In this paper, we address ACS issues concerning credit scoring in a batch of machine learning problems, namely, feature irregularities due to empty features in many records, class imbalance due to non-uniform statistical distributions of the records between classes, and concept drift due to changing statistical characteristics concerning certain classes and features with time. Considering the limited credit scoring data volume, we propose to address the challenge using the Transfer Learning with Lag (TLL) algorithm based on embedded shallow neural networks that enable knowledge transfer when the number of active features changes. Knowledge transfer is based on lags having an adaptive length that is changed based on performance change feedback. Furthermore, the framework proposes classifier aggregation and the chunk balancing mechanism for handling class imbalance. An evaluation was conducted using the Lending club, German, Default, and PPDai datasets. The results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the benchmarks in terms of the majority of classification metrics concerning both time series and overall results.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing and cloud computing, more and more stream analytics applications are being developed including real-time trend prediction and object detection on top of IoT sensing data. One popular type of stream analytics is the recurrent neural network (RNN) deep learning model based time series or sequence data prediction and forecasting. Different from traditional analytics that assumes data are available ahead of time and will not change, stream analytics deals with data that are being generated continuously and data trend/distribution could change (a.k.a. concept drift), which will cause prediction/forecasting accuracy to drop over time. One other challenge is to find the best resource provisioning for stream analytics to achieve good overall latency. In this paper, we study how to best leverage edge and cloud resources to achieve better accuracy and latency for stream analytics using a type of RNN model called long short-term memory (LSTM). We propose a novel edge–cloud integrated framework for hybrid stream analytics that supports low latency inference on the edge and high capacity training on the cloud. To achieve flexible deployment, we study different approaches of deploying our hybrid learning framework including edge-centric, cloud-centric and edge–cloud integrated. Further, our hybrid learning framework can dynamically combine inference results from an LSTM model pre-trained based on historical data and another LSTM model re-trained periodically based on the most recent data. Using real-world and simulated stream datasets, our experiments show the proposed edge–cloud deployment is the best among all three deployment types in terms of latency. For accuracy, the experiments show our dynamic learning approach performs the best among all learning approaches for all three concept drift scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone is a secondary air pollutant that is harmful to living beings and crops. Predicting ozone concentrations at specific locations is thus important to initiate protection measures, i.e. emission reductions or warnings to the population. Ozone levels at specific locations result from emission and sink processes, mixing and chemical transformation along an air parcel's trajectory. Current ozone forecasting systems generally rely on computationally expensive chemistry transport models (CTMs). However, recently several studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning for this task. While a few of these studies were trained on gridded model data, most efforts focus on forecasting time series from individual measurement locations. In this study, we present a hybrid approach which is based on time-series forecasting (up to 4 d) but uses spatially aggregated meteorological and chemical data from upstream wind sectors to represent some aspects of the chemical history of air parcels arriving at the measurement location. To demonstrate the value of this additional information, we extracted pseudo-observation data for Germany from a CTM to avoid extra complications with irregularly spaced and missing data. However, our method can be extended so that it can be applied to observational time series. Using one upstream sector alone improves the forecasts by 10 % during all 4 d, while the use of three sectors improves the mean squared error (MSE) skill score by 14 % during the first 2 d of the prediction but depends on the upstream wind direction. Our method shows its best performance in the northern half of Germany for the first 2 prediction days. Based on the data's seasonality and simulation period, we shed some light on our models' open challenges with (i) spatial structures in terms of decreasing skill scores from the northern German plain to the mountainous south and (ii) concept drifts related to an unusually cold winter season. Here we expect that the inclusion of explainable artificial intelligence methods could reveal additional insights in future versions of our model.  © 2022 Felix Kleinert et al.},

	abstract = {Cloud management systems increasingly rely on machine learning (ML) models to predict incoming workload rates, load, and other system behaviours for efficient dynamic resource management. Current state-of-the-art prediction models demonstrate high accuracy but assume that data patterns remain stable. However, in production use, systems may face hardware upgrades, changes in user behaviour etc. that lead to concept drifts - significant changes in the characteristics of data streams over time. To mitigate prediction deterioration, ML models need to be updated - but questions of when and how to best retrain these models are unsolved in the context of cloud management. We present a pilot study that addresses these questions for one of the most common models for adaptive prediction - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) - using synthetic and real-world workload data. Our analysis of when to retrain explores approaches for detecting when retraining is required using both concept drift detection and prediction error thresholds, and at what point retraining should actually take place. Our analysis of how to retrain focuses on the data required for retraining, and what proportion should be taken from before and after the need for retraining is detected. We present initial results that indicate that retraining of existing models can achieve prediction accuracy close to that of newly trained models but for much less cost, and present initial advice for how to provide cloud management systems with support for automatic retraining of ML-based models.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is an integral part of a number of surveillance applications. However, most of the existing anomaly detection models are statically trained on pre-recorded data from a single source, thus making multiple assumptions about the surrounding environment. As a result, their usefulness is limited to controlled scenarios. In this paper, we fuse information from live streams of audio and video data to detect anomalies in the captured environment. We train a deep learning-based teacher-student network using video, image, and audio information. The pre-trained visual network in the teacher model distills its information to the image and audio networks in the student model. Features from image and audio networks are combined and compressed using principal component analysis. Thus, the teacher-student network produces an image-audio-based light-weight joint representation of the data. The data dynamics are learned in a multivariate adaptive Gaussian mixture model. Empirical results from two audio-visual datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of joint representation over single modalities in the adaptive anomaly detection framework. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by an average of 15.00 % and 14.52 % in AUC values for dataset 1 and dataset 2, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This work focuses on computationally efficient difference metrics of time series and compares two different unsupervised methods for anomaly classification. It takes place in the domain of hardware systems testing for reliability, where several structurally identical devices are tested at the same time with a load expected in their lifetime use. The devices perform different maneuvers in predefined testing cycles. It is possible that rare, unexpected system defects appear. They often show up in the measured data signals of the system, for example as a decrease in the output pressure of a pump. Due to the intended aging of the parts under load, the measured data also exhibits a concept drift, i.e. a shift in the data distribution. It is of interest to detect anomalous behavior as early as possible to reduce cost, save time and enable accurate root-cause-analysis. We formulate this problem as an anomaly detection task on periodic multivariate time series data. Experiments are evaluated using an open access hydraulic test bench data set by Helwig et al. [1]. The method's performance under concept drift is tested by simulating an aging system using the same data set. We find that Mean Squared Error towards the median in combination with the Modified z-Score is the most robust method for this use case. The solution can be applied from the beginning of a hardware testing cycle. The computations are intuitive to understand, and the classification results can be visualized for better interpretability and plausibility analysis. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) have widely been applied for knowledge representation and reasoning. However, in real life, reasoning is always accompanied with hesitation, which is deriving from the uncertainty and fuzziness. Especially, when processing the online data, since the internal and external interference, the distribution and characteristics of sequence data would be considerably changed along with the passage of time, which further increase the difficulty of modeling. In this article, based on intuitionistic fuzzy set theory, a new dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map (DIFCM) scheme is proposed for online data prediction. Combined with a novel detection algorithm of concept drift, the structure of DIFCM can be adaptively updated with the online learning scheme, which can effectively improve the representation of online information by capturing the real-time changes of sequence data. Moreover, in order to tackle with the possible hesitancy in the process of modeling, intuitionistic fuzzy set is applied in the construction of dynamic FCM, where hesitation degree as a quantitative index explicitly expresses the hesitancy. Finally, a series of experiments using public data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

Further, distributed machine learning can be an efficient technique to improve performance, increase accuracy, and scale to larger input sizes.In this paper, we introduce a framework that combines the computational capabilities of Apache Spark and the workflow parallelization of Ray for distributed incremental learning. We conduct an empirical analysis of our framework for time series forecasting using the Walmart M5 dataset.

	abstract = {In a data stream, concept drift refers to unpredictable distribution changes over time, which violates the identical-distribution assumption required by conventional machine learning methods. Current concept drift adaptation techniques mostly focus on a data stream with changing distributions. However, since each variable of a data stream is a time series, these variables normally have temporal dependency problems in the real world. How to solve concept drift and temporal dependency problems at the same time is rarely discussed in the concept-drift literature. To solve this situation, this article proves and validates that the testing error decreases faster if a predictor is trained on a temporally reconstructed space when drift occurs. Based on this theory, a novel drift adaptation regression (DAR) framework is designed to predict the label variable for data streams with concept drift and temporal dependency. A new statistic called local drift degree (LDD+) is proposed and used as a drift adaptation technique in the DAR framework to discard outdated instances in a timely way, thereby guaranteeing that the most relevant instances will be selected during the training process. The performance of DAR is demonstrated by a set of experimental evaluations on both synthetic data and real-world data streams. © 2012 IEEE.},

With digital representations that look-like, behave-like, and connect to a physical system, digital twins bring together critical operational and asset data into a single knowledge store. However, a high-fidelity digital twin relying on the cloud in real-time with direct influence on operations exposes the plant to cyber attacks. We propose a software architecture for a Digital Twin that adaptively generates more accurate representations of its operations to detect malicious activities and mitigate their effects. To achieve this adaptivity, our solution leverages ML, time-series forecasting, concept drift detection and control stability analysis. To evaluate our solution, we develop a simulation of a simple industrial plant consisting of one PID-controlled steam-boiler and a variety of uncertainties. Our experimental evaluation suggests that Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control, a system identification technique, best contributes towards Self-Learning by producing verifiable models that better align the need for retraining with concept drifts. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Domains such as manufacturing and medicine crave for continuous monitoring and analysis of their processes, especially in combination with time series as produced by sensors. Time series data can be exploited to, for example, explain and predict concept drifts during runtime. Generally, a certain data volume is required in order to produce meaningful analysis results. However, reliable data sets are often missing, for example, if event streams and times series data are collected separately, in case of a new process, or if it is too expensive to obtain a sufficient data volume. Additional challenges arise with preparing time series data from multiple event sources, variations in data collection frequency, and concept drift. This paper proposes the GENLOG approach to generate reliable event and time series data that follows the distribution of the underlying input data set. GENLOG employs data resampling and enables the user to select different parts of the log data to orchestrate the training of a recurrent neural network for stream generation. The generated data is sampled back to its original sample rate and is embedded into the originating log data file. Overall, GENLOG can boost small data sets and consequently the application of online process mining. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Process monitoring, which is used to ensure the product quality in semiconductor manufacturing, develops a control chart and alerts engineers whenever a control limit is exceeded. However, a late alarm could generate defects or scraps, and thus, a prealarm is urgent to be developed. This study proposes an in-line predictive monitoring (ILPM) framework that uses process parameter monitoring (PPM) in the first phase and equipment parameter monitoring (EPM) in the second phase. PPM includes off-line training and in-line prediction, where we collect the first half of time-series data and predict the second half for in-line quality control. To maintain robustness and accuracy, the concept drift is used to update the ILPM model in real time; specifically, the EPM detects the loss of prediction by cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart or detects the change of equipment parameters by Bayesian approach for developing retraining mechanism. An empirical study of a semiconductor manufacturer indicates that the proposed ILPM framework improved both the quality control and production capacity. Note to Practitioners-Although some in-line monitoring approaches have been proposed for specific conditions, little research has been done to develop a prealarm method; in particular, this study proposes predictive monitoring by using data from multiple sensors (or status variable identifications, SVIDs) to predict one sensor in one process step of semiconductor manufacturer. The prealarm benefits the early troubleshooting and equipment capacity. This study also applies concept drift and equipment parameter monitoring (EPM) to identify the prediction model misalignment or equipment misalignment. In practice, root cause identification of the prediction error is critical and benefits the model retraining and equipment maintenance.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Despite the rapid advance of unsupervised reconstruction models in online service fault diagnosis, existing methods still lead to frequent false positive or false negative alarms. Tracing to the cause, popular reconstruction frameworks may fall into an “identical shortcut”, where both normal and anomalous cases can be well-recovered and hence faults are escaped from monitoring. Moreover, regularly “concept drift” deployed by online services always leads to sequences distribution dramatically change, which is easily wrongly-detected as anomalies. In this work, we present SS-Attention to avoid two contradictory false alarms simultaneously in a unified framework. Specifically, we first revisit the frameworks of MLP, CNN, and transformer, and confirm the important role of self-attention in preventing the model from learning shortcut, which we therefore select as our backbone. Second, we come up with a sparse attention layer to help model capture more long-term dependencies and distinguish local “concept drift” from anomalies. Third, we propose a semi-attention layer that urges model only learn from normal regions and further avoid well-recovering the faults. We evaluate our model on three public online service datasets and surpass the state-of-the-art alternatives by a sufficiently large margin, achieving an average 95.91% F1-Score with an approx. 34.48% economy of training time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Concept drift is detected by the cloud with the use of the extended adaptive windowing algorithm that operates on statistics of time sequences tracked by the gateway. This system is geared toward providing accurate predictions of nonstationary industrial processes for intelligent factory automation and safety. The proposed TriLS system is evaluated on records of recurring chemical processes collected at two plants and implemented on a Raspberry Pi board. TriLS achieves a lower prediction error than the reference adaptive schemes while reducing the computational effort and memory requirements for adaptation at the gateway by over 66% and 48%, respectively. It also reduces the volume of shared data between the gateway and the cloud by 40%-72% that is a significant cut on communications overhead.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) models stand out as data-driven non-parametric models of easy implementation and high accuracy. Unfortunately, FTS encounters difficulties when dealing with data sets of many variables and scenarios with concept drift. We present a new approach to handle high-dimensional non-stationary time series, by projecting the original high-dimensional data into a low dimensional embedding space and using FTS approach. Combining these techniques enables a better representation of the complex content of non-stationary multivariate time series and accurate forecasts.

	abstract = {Time series prediction has great practical value in a wide range of real-world scenarios such as stock market and retail. Existing methods typically face model aging issue caused by the concept drift: the model performance degrades along time. Undoubtedly, the model aging issue can cause serious damage in practical usage, e.g. wrong predictions in stock price may cause catastrophic losses in the financial domain. Therefore, it is essential to address the model aging issue so as to promise the predictor's performance in the future. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to address the issue. First, we uncover the theoretical connection between the complex concept drift in time series data and the gradients of deep neural networks. Based on this, we propose a novel framework called learning to learn the future. Specifically, we develop a learning method to model the concept drift during the inference stage, which can help the model generalize well in the future. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of noises and randomness of time series data, we propose to enhance the framework by leveraging similar series in concept drift modeling. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first general solution to model aging issue in time series prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, which validate the effectiveness of our framework. For instance, it achieves a relative improvement of 33% in stock price prediction over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 ACM.},

In response, we propose a replacement learning-based online adaptation framework for multivariate multi-step time series forecasting in the energy domain. This method tackles concept drift by retraining models from scratch, leveraging historical data via clustering-based sampling and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, the forecast model's predictions are refined using the proposed correcting factor, which serves to adjust for any inherent bias present in the forecasting model. Additionally, we develop an incremental learning model that adapts to concept drift by building on the previous model, offering a comparative analysis and investigation of incremental learning. Evaluations using synthetic building electricity demand and cooling system electricity demand datasets demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of our proposed replacement learning adaptation, outperforming offline models by over 50% across various dataset characteristics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

In this paper, we propose to use model compression in the streaming setting in order to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. We show that compressing a highly performing dynamic ensemble into an individual model leads to better predictive performance when compared to an individual learner while significantly reducing computational costs.

	abstract = {Both the complex and evolving nature of time series data make forecasting among one of the most challenging tasks in machine learning. Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them are universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasters together appears as a promising solution to tackle this task. While several approaches in the context of time series forecasting have focused on how to combine individual models in an ensemble, ranging from simple and enhanced averaging tactics to applying meta-learning methods, few works have tackled the task of ensemble pruning, i.e. individual model selection to take part in the ensemble. In addition, in classical ML literature, ensemble pruning techniques are mostly restricted to operate in a static manner. To deal with changes in the relative performance of models as well as changes in the data distribution, we employ gradient-based saliency maps for online ensemble pruning of deep neural networks. This method consists of generating individual models’ performance saliency maps that are subsequently used to prune the ensemble by taking into account both aspects of accuracy and diversity. In addition, the saliency maps can be exploited to provide suitable explanations for the reason behind selecting specific models to construct an ensemble that plays the role of a forecaster at a certain time interval or instant. An extensive empirical study on many real-world datasets demonstrates that our method achieves excellent or on par results in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches as well as several baselines.

	abstract = {When monitoring highly dynamic time series streaming data, the traditional anomaly detection methods have many disadvantages, e.g., inadaptability to the dynamic streaming data and low detection accuracy. In order to distinguish abnormal data from streaming data, a Markov Process-Based anomaly detection method is proposed. Firstly, the dimensionality of raw data is reduced through Locality Preserving Projection algorithm to bring redundancy down. Then, an Elbow-Based K-Means clustering algorithm is proposed to determine the rational number of mode, and the dimensionally-reduced data are divided into normal and abnormal modes through the algorithm. Finally, a Markov Process-Based anomaly detection model is established to detect the data in abnormal mode, where the effect of concept drift is avoided and a loose mode containing the data in the future unknown mode is introduced into the model to enhance model integrity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve quasi-optimal performance compared with other contrasting methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection in data streams comes with different technical challenges due to the data nature. The main challenges include storage limitations, the speed of data arrival, and concept drifts. In the literature, methods for mining data streams in order to detect anomalies have been proposed. While some methods focus on tackling a specific issue, other methods handle diverse problems but may have high complexity (time and memory). In the present work, we propose DragStream, a novel subsequence anomaly and concept drift detection algorithm for univariate data streams. DragStream extends the subsequence anomaly detection method for time series data Drag to streaming data. Furthermore, the new method is inspired by the well-known Matrix Profile, Drag, and MILOF which are respectively point and subsequence anomaly detection methods for time series and data streams. We conducted intensive experiments and statistical analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against existing methods. The results show that our method is competitive in performance while being linear in time and memory complexity. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of the new method.  © 2022 IEEE.},

In this article, based on Riemannian manifolds and statistical process control, we propose a novel online algorithm for the concept drift detection of time series. Using the online segmentations with multiple sliding windows, phase space reconstruction of time series is implemented, based on which multi-scale features of series data are calculated. By means of information geometry theory, the obtained features are projected into Riemannian manifolds for the evading of noise interference and structural redundancy in the time series. Finally, with statistical process control, the detection of concept drifts is implemented. The experimental results reveal the promising detection performances verified by both artificial data sets and real-life data sets. © 2023 The Franklin Institute},

An ensemble strategically combines multiple techniques and tends to be robust and more precise compared to a single intelligent algorithmic model. In this work, a dynamic particle swarm optimization-based empirical mode decomposition ensemble is proposed for nonstationary data prediction. The proposed ensemble implements an environmental change detection technique to capture concept drift occurring and the intrinsic nonlinearity in time series, hence improving prediction accuracy. The proposed ensemble technique was experimentally evaluated on electric time series datasets. The obtained results show that the proposed technique improves prediction accuracy and it outperformed several state-of-the-art techniques in several cases.

Time series analysis and modeling is a new research field in financial econometrics. High-frequency time series usually refers to the financial data collected at the frequency of hour, minute or even second. This paper improves the data mining method of ARIMA model and empirically analyzes the improved model with the stock price data of American IT industry. The results show that the improved model is more accurate in predicting future stock prices. Statistical prediction is the use of statistics and other methods, quantitative or qualitative analysis of things to get the predicted results of a method. Many statistical prediction algorithms have been widely used in real production and life. A composite mining model is synthesized to obtain multiple financial time series of the same category. The practice of agricultural price time series mining proves that the financial time series mining model can use the mined knowledge to conduct qualitative analysis on the trend of financial time series, which can effectively guide users' market behavior and assist users in making decisions. The time variability of data content requires that mining algorithms have the ability to deal with concept drift and reflect the evolution of data.

However, an implicit assumption of most load forecasting methods is that future data looks similar to past data. Unfortunately, this assumption often does not hold; for example, recruiting new staff or a pandemic can lead to demand changes resulting in so-called concept drifts in the underlying data. Most methods for coping with such concept drifts rely on computationally expensive retraining. We propose a new method for coping with concept drifts based on profiles and a linear regression model that avoids expensive retraining. Compared to a simple baseline and five state-of-The-Art benchmark models on two different data sets, our method has lower computational costs and higher forecast accuracy, making it especially interesting for smart grid applications.  © 2022 Owner/Author.},

Traditional Spectral Residual (SR) anomaly detection methods do not take into account the interference of certain human factors (e.g., changes in personal preferences) in certain scenarios, i.e., concept drift. In these scenarios, the accuracy of anomaly detection is bound to be affected. In order to guarantee the availability and stability of network services, we propose an intelligent and pervasive anomaly detection strategy, CD-SR. First, we use the traditional SR model and the SVM method to train the time series that have not drifted to determine the threshold value. Then, to solve the problem of the pervasiveness of application scenarios, we use a drift detection model to find the time series where concept drift occurs. Finally, the sequence where the concept drift occurs is imported into the drift adaptation model to complete the replacement of the old and new concepts, the data is processed in real-time, and the replaced data is detected again in the detection model for anomalies. In the experimental stage, we obtained several data metrics using the cloud platform system built by Openstack, and by comparing several mainstream anomaly detection algorithms, our method obtained superior results.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In today’s interconnected society, large volumes of time-series data are usually collected from real-time applications. This data is generally used for data-driven decision-making. With time, changes may emerge in the statistical characteristics of this data - this is also known as concept drift. A concept drift can be detected using a concept drift detector. An ideal detector should detect drift accurately and efficiently. However, these properties may not be easy to achieve. To address this gap, a novel drift detection method WinDrift (WD) is presented in this research. The foundation of WD is the early detection of concept drift using corresponding and hierarchical time windows. To assess drift, the proposed method uses two sample hypothesis tests with Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical distance. These tests are carried out on sliding windows configured on multiple hierarchical levels that assess drift by comparing statistical distance between two windows of corresponding time period on each level. To evaluate the efficacy of WD, 4 real datasets and 10 reproducible synthetic datasets are used. A comparison with 5 existing state-of-the-art drift detection methods demonstrates that WinDrift detects drift efficiently with minimal false alarms and has efficient computational resource usage.

	abstract = {Detecting changes in data streams, with the data flowing continuously, is an important problem which Industry 4.0 has to deal with. In industrial monitoring, the data distribution may vary after a change in the machine’s operating point; this situation is known as concept drift, and it is key to detecting this change. One drawback of conventional machine learning algorithms is that they are usually static, trained offline, and require monitoring at the input level. A change in the distribution of data, in the relationship between the input and the output data, would result in the deterioration of the predictive performance of the models due to the lack of an ability to generalize the model to new concepts. Drift detecting methods emerge as a solution to identify the concept drift in the data. This paper proposes a new approach for concept drift detection—a novel approach to deal with sudden or abrupt drift, the most common drift found in industrial processes-, called CatSight. Briefly, this method is composed of two steps: (i) Use of Common Spatial Patterns (a statistical approach to deal with data streaming, closely related to Principal Component Analysis) to maximize the difference between two different distributions of a multivariate temporal data, and (ii) Machine Learning conventional algorithms to detect whether a change in the data flow has been occurred or not. The performance of the CatSight method, has been evaluated on a real use case, training six state of the art Machine Learning (ML) classifiers; obtained results indicate how adequate the new approach is. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Ensemble pruning can effectively overcome several shortcomings of the classical ensemble learning paradigm, such as the relatively high time and space complexity. However, each predictor has its own unique ability. One predictor may not perform well on some samples, but it will perform very well on other samples. Blindly underestimating the power of specific predictors is unreasonable. Choosing the best predictor set for each query sample is exactly what dynamic ensemble pruning techniques address. This paper proposes a hybrid Time Series Prediction (TSP) algorithm to implement one-step-ahead prediction task, integrating Dynamic Ensemble Pruning (DEP), Incremental Learning (IL), and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), abbreviated as the EnsPKDE&IncLKDE algorithm. It dynamically selects proper predictor sets based on the kernel density distribution of all base learners’ prediction values. Due to the characteristic of TSP problems that samples arrive in chronological order, the idea of IL is naturally introduced into EnsPKDE&IncLKDE, while DEP is a common technology to address the concept drift issue inherent in IL. The algorithm is divided into three subprocesses: 1) Overproduction, which generates the original ensemble learning system; 2) Dynamic Ensemble Pruning (DEP), achieved by one subalgorithm called EnsPKDE; 3) Incremental Learning (IL), realized by one subalgorithm termed IncLKDE. Benefited from the advantages of integrating Dynamic Ensemble Pruning scheme, Incremental Learning paradigm and Kernel Density Estimation, in the experimental results, EnsPKDE&IncLKDE demonstrates superior prediction performance to several other state-of-the-art algorithms in fulfilling time series forecasting tasks. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Recent decade, On-line Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) and its variant algorithms are widely used for time series prediction with efficient and accuracy performance. However, due to random weights selection in OS-ELM and characteristic of non-stationary data, the unstable prediction performance and the concept drift problem appear in the training process. In this study, two proposed methods are used in the conventional Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM). Firstly, new Xavier weights selection method is employed to replace the conventional weights selection method in OS-ELM, which reduces the unstable performance and improves the forecasting ability. Secondly, to solve concept drift problem, an Adaptive Forgetting Factor method is proposed. Finally, based on these two methods, a novel time series prediction model called Recurrent Xavier Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Forgetting Factor (RXOS-ELM-AFF) is proposed for the long-term time series prediction. The ability of our model is assessed on one artificial data set and five financial data.

	abstract = {The execution of processes leaves trails of event data in information systems. These event data are analyzed to generate insights and improvements for the underlying process. However, companies do not execute these processes in a vacuum. The fast pace of technological development, constantly changing market environments, and fast consumer responses expose companies to high levels of uncertainty. This uncertainty often manifests itself in significant changes in the executed processes. Such significant changes are called concept drifts. Transparency about concept drifts is crucial to respond quickly and adequately, limiting the potentially negative impact of such drifts. Three types of knowledge are of interest to a process owner: When did a drift occur, what happened, and why did it happen. This paper introduces a framework to extract concept drifts and their potential root causes from event data. We extract time series describing process measures, detect concept drifts, and test these drifts for correlation. This framework generalizes existing work such that object-centric event data with multiple case notions, non-linear relationships, and an arbitrary number of process measures are supported. We provide an extendable implementation and evaluate our framework concerning the sensitivity of the time series construction and scalability of cause–effect testing. Furthermore, we provide a case study uncovering an explainable concept drift. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The existence of an anomaly detection method that is optimal for all domains is a myth. Thus, there exists a plethora of anomaly detection methods which increases every year for a wide variety of domains. But a strength can also be a weakness; given this massive library of methods, how can one select the best method for their application? Current literature is focused on creating new anomaly detection methods or large frameworks for experimenting with multiple methods at the same time. However, and especially as the literature continues to expand, an extensive evaluation of every anomaly detection method is simply not feasible. To reduce this evaluation burden, we present guidelines to intelligently choose the optimal anomaly detection methods based on the characteristics the time series displays such as seasonality, trend, level change concept drift, and missing time steps. We provide a comprehensive experimental validation and survey of twelve anomaly detection methods over different time series characteristics to form guidelines based on several metrics: the AUC (Area Under the Curve), windowed F-score, and Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) scoring model. Applying our methodologies can save time and effort by surfacing the most promising anomaly detection methods instead of experimenting extensively with a rapidly expanding library of anomaly detection methods, especially in an online setting. ©2021 AI Access Foundation.

	abstract = {With the exponential expansion of the interconnected world, we have large volume, variety and velocity of the data flowing through the systems. The dependencies on these systems have crossed the threshold of business value, and now such communications have started to be classified as essential systems. As such, these systems have become vital social infrastructure that needs all of prediction, monitoring, safe guard and immediate decision-making in case of threats. The key enabler is data stream analytics (DSA). In DSA, the key areas of stream processing constitute prediction and forecasting, classification, clustering, mining frequent patterns and finding frequent item sets (FISs), detecting concept drift, building synopsis structures to answer standing and ad hoc queries, sampling and loadshedding in the case of bursts of data and processing data streams emanating from a very large number of interconnected devices typical for Internet-of-Things (IoT). The processing complexity is impacted by the multidimensionality of the stream data objects, building `forgetting’ as a key construct in the processing, leveraging the time-series aspect to aid the processing and so on. In this chapter, we explore some of the aforementioned areas and provide a survey in each of these selected areas.

This paper investigates the online learning for ocean data streams by resolving two main challenges: (i) how to develop a deep learning model to capture the complex ocean data distribution that could evolve dynamically, namely tackling the 'concept drift' problem for non-stationary time series; (ii) how to develop a deep learning model that can dynamically adapt its structure from shallow to deep with the inflow of the data to overcome under-fitting problem, namely tackling the 'model selection' problem. To tackle these challenges, we propose one Evolutive Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) that dynamically re-weighting the sub-structure of the model from data streams in a sequential or online learning fashion, by which the capacity scalability and sustainability are introduced into the model. The experiments on real ocean observation data verify the effectiveness of our model.

	abstract = {With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, data-driven decision making has also become an integral part of decision making. At the same time, deep learning is one of the core technologies of the fourth industrial revolution that have become vital in decision making. However, in the era of epidemics and big data, the volume of data has increased dramatically while the sources have become progressively more complex, making data distribution highly susceptible to change. These situations can easily lead to concept drift, which directly affects the effectiveness of prediction models. How to cope with such complex situations and make timely and accurate decisions from multiple perspectives is a challenging research issue. To address this challenge, we summarize concept drift adaptation methods under the deep learning framework, which is beneficial to help decision makers make better decisions and analyze the causes of concept drift. First, we provide an overall introduction to concept drift, including the definition, causes, types, and process of concept drift adaptation methods under the deep learning framework. Second, we summarize concept drift adaptation methods in terms of discriminative learning, generative learning, hybrid learning, and others. For each aspect, we elaborate on the update modes, detection modes, and adaptation drift types of concept drift adaptation methods. In addition, we briefly describe the characteristics and application fields of deep learning algorithms using concept drift adaptation methods. Finally, we summarize common datasets and evaluation metrics and present future directions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection in Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data plays an important role in multiple domains, especially in cybersecurity, for the detection of unknown attacks. DC- VAE is a recent approach we have proposed for anomaly detection in network measurement multivariate data, which uses Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs) and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to model complex and high-dimensional MTS data. However, detecting anomalies using VAEs can result in performance degradation and even catastrophic forgetting when trained on dynamic and evolving network measurements, particularly in the event of concept drifts. We extend DC- VAE to a continual learning setup, leveraging the generative AI properties of the underlying models to deal with continually evolving data. We introduce GenDeX, an approach to Generative AI-based anomaly detection which compresses the patterns extracted from past measurements into a generative model that can synthesize MTS data out of input Gaussian noise, mimicking the characteristics of the MTS data used for training. GenDeX relies on a Deep Generative Replay paradigm to realize continual learning, combining synthesized past MTS measurements with new observations to update the detection model. Using a large-scale, multi-dimensional network monitoring dataset collected from an operational mobile Internet Service Provider (ISP), we showcase the functionality of DC-VAE in the event of concept drifts, and study in-depth its generative characteristics, assessing GenDeX synthetically generated MTS examples. GenDeX enables DC- VAE adapting to continually evolving data, overcoming the limitations of catastrophic forgetting.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nanorobots have been used in smart health to collect time series data such as electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms. Real-time classification of dynamic time series signals in nanorobots is a challenging task. Nanorobots in the nanoscale range require a classification algorithm with low computational complexity. First, the classification algorithm should be able to dynamically analyze time series signals and update itself to process the concept drifts (CD). Second, the classification algorithm should have the ability to handle catastrophic forgetting (CF) and classify historical data. Most importantly, the classification algorithm should be energy-efficient to use less computing power and memory to classify signals in real-time on a smart nanorobot. To solve these challenges, we design an algorithm that can Prevent Concept Drift in Online continual Learning for time series classification (PCDOL). The prototype suppression item in PCDOL can reduce the impact caused by CD. It also solves the CF problem through the replay feature. The computation per second and the memory consumed by PCDOL are only 3.572M and 1KB, respectively. The experimental results show that PCDOL is better than several state-of-the-art methods for dealing with CD and CF in energy-efficient nanorobots. IEEE},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, incremental machine learning for streaming data has gained significant attention due to the need to learn from a constantly evolving stream of data without the need to store it. The advent of big data has further fuelled research on developing systems that can cope with continuously changing data streams and tackle the challenges associated with historical data requirements. The problem of time series forecasting has been studied using varied approaches like neural networks, ensemble methods, decision trees and rules, support vector machines to name a few. However, neural network models have gained particular attention in dealing with changing data distribution due to their generalization abilities. In this paper, we propose a prequential framework named PS-PGSM which involves incrementally training the base models and online Regions of Competence (ROC) computation followed by selection of the best forecaster for the task of time series forecasting using saliency maps. We build upon the state-of-the-art approach named OS-PGSM (Online Model Selection using Performance Gradient based Saliency Maps) in which the model training and ROC computation is performed offline. Past research has demonstrated that a set of different models enables specialization for each model compared to a single forecasting model which is particularly useful when predicting for an evolving time series sequence. Our approach uses saliency maps for prequential calculation of ROC for each model to find the best forecaster based on the performance of each model. We evaluate the proposed approach against OS-PGSM, as well as against previous best performing model by first conducting preliminary experiments on 10 real-world time series datasets and then using 2 real-world big datasets to showcase its applicability to big data. Experimental results not only validate the effectiveness of our approach for big data but also demonstrate superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time efficiency while also handling concept drift. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, more and more unmanned systems are adopting time series anomaly detection algorithms as the primary tool for KPI monitoring. However, many anomalous data in real environments often have complex features such as large data fluctuations, irregular data fluctuations and large data drift. Traditional univariate or multivariate anomaly detection algorithms can hardly meet the demand for anomaly detection of time series with many features and large fluctuations. Therefore, we propose a multivariate anomaly detection framework adapted to complex environments, which can effectively reduce the complexity of time series data and improve the overall performance of anomaly detection algorithms in complex real systems. First, data preprocessing is performed on the time series before anomaly detection to reduce the impact of temporal bias of different data items in multivariate time series data. Second, to intuitively analyze the anomalous fluctuation characteristics of the time series, we use Spectral Residual to process the significance of the time series. Then, we combine the Spectral Residual processed data and Logistic Regression algorithm to construct anomaly classifiers for anomaly detection of real-time data in complex real systems. Finally, by experimenting with a prototype system on a private cloud platform, our approach obtains superior results under multiple anomaly patterns compared with traditional univariate and multivariate anomaly detection algorithms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Learning from data appearing in real time is quite a call, due in part to the speed at which new data appears. Hidden data changes that are not previously known to learning algorithms are referred to in the literature as data or concept drift. In classical machine learning, a classifier analyzes new data using past training instances of the data stream. However, the accuracy of the classifier deteriorates due to data drift, which occurs in non-stationary data. In such situations, the classifier must detect a significant change in the data adapt its prediction over time.

	abstract = {Concept drift is the phenomenon where the data distribution in a data stream changes over time. It is a ubiquitous problem in the real-world, for example, a traffic accident would cause a jam in a certain period, leading to a distribution change in traffic speed. Most research in the concept drift field focuses on single data stream, however, few of them consider multi-stream environments which are more in line with the application needs. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stream prediction setting and a multi-stream concept drift self-adaptation framework using graph neural network, named SAGN. In SAGN, we reconsider the learning procedure of GNN-based predictors from an aspect of concept drift adaptation for multi-stream. By this design, the prediction task is converted into online streaming data tasks in sub-graphs. Each sub-graph corresponds to an adaptation target and will be updated over time. In this way, locally we can overcome drift in each sub-graph by a designed adaptation technique, and globally the correlation between different data streams is well-preserved as a graph structure. Therefore, whether drift occurs or not, in one or several streams, SAGNcan provide consistently accurate prediction results. We comprehensively tested SAGNon both synthetic and real-world, drift and non-drift data in the multi-step prediction task. The experiment results show that SAGNis able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. IEEE},

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are capital instruments for protecting ATM networks against intrusion, and subsequently ensuring the integrity of air traffic. An anomaly detection approach in such systems enables the detection of multiple types of attacks with the aid of a threshold as a criterion for differentiating between normal activity and unusual events in the network. IDS with fixed threshold fail to detect the presence of patterns in the data, thus hampering proper detection ability, and requiring regular human intervention. Detection ability of IDS can be improved by establishing an automated system that recognises pattern shifts in evolving data streams and adjusts the threshold accordingly. Our work focuses on designing an algorithm to recognize the occurrence of new patterns and adjust the threshold consequently for enhanced anomaly detection, whilst offering flexibility for different frameworks and scalability to cope with large data streams. In this article, we present an adaptive threshold approach based on extreme value theory, which aims to automatically detect concept drifts in radar data streams. We evaluate our method in a practical scenario of anomaly detection on time series data collected by air traffic radars across France and show that we can achieve a threefold performance improvement over a standard approach using a fixed threshold. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this article, we propose a prediction error measure for continual learning, to detect concept drift induced from learned data input before the learning step. In addition, we check this measure’s ability for characterization of the drift. For these purposes, we propose an algorithm to compute the proposed measure on a data stream while also estimating concept drift. Then, we calculate the correlation coefficients between this estimate and our measurement, using time series analysis. To validate our proposal, we base our experiments on simulated streams of metadata collected from an industrial dataset corresponding to real conversation data. The results show that the proposed measure constitutes a reliable criterion for concept drift detection. They also show that a characterization of the drift relative to components of the stream is possible thanks to the proposed measure. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Recently, the increasing availability of massive broadcast GPS data has encouraged the exploration of this issue under different perspectives. One possible solution is to build a data-driven real-time taxi-dispatching recommender system. However, existing systems are based on strong assumptions such as stationary demand distributions and finite training sets, which make them inadequate for modeling the dynamic nature of the network. In this paper, we propose BRIGHT: a drift-aware supervised learning framework which aims to provide accurate predictions for short-term horizon taxi demand quantities through a creative ensemble of time series analysis methods that handle distinct types of concept drift. A large experimental set-up which includes three real-world transportation networks and a synthetic test-bed with artificially inserted concept drifts, was employed to illustrate the advantages of BRIGHT when compared to S.o.A methods for this problem. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms perform differently in settings with varying levels of training set mislabeling noise. Therefore, the choice of the right algorithm for a particular learning problem is crucial. The contribution of this paper is towards two, dual problems: first, comparing algorithm behavior; and second, choosing learning algorithms for noisy settings. We present the “sigmoid rule” framework, which can be used to choose the most appropriate learning algorithm depending on the properties of noise in a classification problem. The framework uses an existing model of the expected performance of learning algorithms as a sigmoid function of the signal-to-noise ratio in the training instances. We study the characteristics of the sigmoid function using five representative non-sequential classifiers, namely, Naïve Bayes, kNN, SVM, a decision tree classifier, and a rule-based classifier, and three widely used sequential classifiers based on hidden Markov models, conditional random fields and recursive neural networks. Based on the sigmoid parameters we define a set of intuitive criteria that are useful for comparing the behavior of learning algorithms in the presence of noise. Furthermore, we show that there is a connection between these parameters and the characteristics of the underlying dataset, showing that we can estimate an expected performance over a dataset regardless of the underlying algorithm. The framework is applicable to concept drift scenarios, including modeling user behavior over time, and mining of noisy time series of evolving nature. © 2016, The Author(s).},

Nevertheless, data streams forecasting require high-performance implementations due to the high incoming samples rate. In this work, we proposed to tune-up three ensembles, which operates with the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine, using high-performance techniques. We reim-plemented them in the C programming language with Intel MKL and MPI libraries. The Intel MKL provides functions that explore the multithread features in multicore CPUs, which expands the parallelism to multiprocessors architectures. The MPI allows us to parallelize tasks with distributed memory on several processes, which can be allocated within a single computational node, or spread over several nodes. In summary, our proposal consists of a two-level parallelization, where we allocated each ensemble model into an MPI process, and we parallelized the internal functions of each model in a set of threads through Intel MKL. Thus, the objective of this work is to verify if our proposals provide a significant improvement in execution time when compared to the respective conventional serial approaches. For the experiments, we used a synthetic and a real dataset. Experimental results showed that, in general, the high-performance ensembles improve the execution time, when compared with its serial version, performing up to 10-fold faster. © 2018 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a nsDBN learning method that can handle gradual concept drift well. This method first learns the initial DBN structure using local search and global optimization algorithms and then updates the transition networks by continuously searching the structure space with one edge change for each step. The Bayesian-Dirichlet equivalent (BDe) metric is extended for efficient calculation and local searching sub-tasks are executed in parallel from historical local optimized structures. The experimental evaluations show that this method had better precision than other popular methods when learning nsDBN from stream data with gradual concept drift. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Multidimensional data streams are a major paradigm in data science. They are always related to time, albeit to different degrees. They may represent actual time series or quasi-stationary phenomena that feature longer-term variability, e.g., changes in statistical distribution or a cyclical behavior. In these non-stationary conditions, a given model is expected to be appropriate only in a temporal neighborhood of the time when it has been validated/learned. Its validity may decrease smoothly with time (concept drift), or there may be sudden changes, for instance when switching from one operating condition to a new one (concept shift). The proposed approach consists in studying a clustering process able to adapt to streaming data, by implementing a continuous learning exploiting the input patterns as they arrive. Based on this idea we specifically exploit the ability of possibilistic clustering [2] to cluster iteratively using both batch (sliding-window) and online (by-pattern) strategies that track and adapt to concept drift and shift in a natural way. Measures of fuzzy “outlierness” and fuzzy outlier density are obtained as intrinsic by-products of the possibilistic clustering technique adopted. These measures are used to modulate the amount of incremental learning according to the different regimes required by non-stationary data stream clustering. The proposed method is used as a generative model to assess and improve the accuracy of a forecaster based of a neural network ensemble [1]. The generative model provides two kinds of information: The first is used to partition the data for obtaining a specialized forecaster for each cluster; the second allows us to provide a soft rejection, i.e., a fuzzy evaluation of outlierness that is a symptom of a possibly anomalous pattern. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

In particular, OPOSSAM keeps long-term memory consistent by reducing redundant samples with large prediction errors, and automatically adjusts the prediction model based on short-term memory from the prior model learned from the entire memory in order to deal with concept drift.

	abstract = {Most of time series deriving from complex systems in real life is non-stationary, where the data distribution would be influenced by various internal/external factors such that the contexts are persistently changing. Therefore, the concept drift detection of time series has practical significance. In this paper, a novel method called online entropy-based time domain feature extraction (ETFE) for concept drift detection is proposed. Firstly, the empirical mode decomposition based on extrema symmetric extension is used to decompose time series, where features in various time scales can be adaptively extracted. Meanwhile, the end point effect caused by traditional empirical mode decomposition can be avoided. Secondly, by using the entropy calculation, the time-domain features are coarse-grained to quantify the structure and complexity of the time series, among which six kinds of entropy are used for discussion. Finally, a statistical process control method based on generalized likelihood ratio is used to monitor the change of the entropy, which can effectively track the mean and amplitude of the time series. Therefore, the early alarm of concept drift can be given. Synthetic data sets and neonatal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings with seizures annotations data sets are used to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this work we present a machine learning based approach for detecting drifting behavior – so-called concept drifts – in continuous data streams. The motivation for this contribution originates from the currently intensively investigated topic Predictive Maintenance (PdM), which refers to a proactive way of triggering servicing actions for industrial machinery. The aim of this maintenance strategy is to identify wear and tear, and consequent malfunctioning by analyzing condition monitoring data, recorded by sensor equipped machinery, in real-time. Recent developments in this area have shown potential to save time and material by preventing breakdowns and improving the overall predictability of industrial processes. However, due to the lack of high quality monitoring data and only little experience concerning the applicability of analysis methods, real-world implementations of Predictive Maintenance are still rare. Within this contribution, we present a method, to detect concept drift in data streams as potential indication for defective system behavior and depict initial tests on synthetic data sets. Further on, we present a real-world case study with industrial radial fans and discuss promising results gained from applying the detailed approach in this scope. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Analysis and processing of time-series data has been studied over the past decades and has resulted in several promising algorithms. Clustering continuous data is an interesting subset of unsupervised learning models to process and categorise the data. Over a long period and with a large number of samples most conventional data streams will converge to Gaussian distributions. The existing clustering methods for continuous data are usually suitable for this type of data. However, with growing volumes of real world observation and measurements, (i.e. Internet of Things data), the data sets become more volatile and have multi-variate distributions. In this paper we propose a dynamic and adaptable clustering algorithm for multi-variate time-series data clustering. We have evaluated our work against some well-known time-series clustering methods and have shown how the proposed method can reduce the complexity and perform efficient in multi-variate data streams. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Over past years, various attempts have been made at analysing Time Series (TS) which has been raising great interest of Data Mining community due to its special data format and broad application scenarios. An important aspect in TS analysis is Time Series Classification (TSC), which has been applied in medical diagnosis, human activity recognition, industrial troubleshooting, etc. Typically, all TSC work trains a stable model from an off-line TS dataset, without considering potential Concept Drift in streaming context. Domains like healthcare look to enrich the database gradually with more medical cases, or in astronomy, with human's growing knowledge about the universe, the theoretical basis for labelling data will change. The techniques applied in a stable TS dataset are then not adaptable in such dynamic scenarios (i.e. streaming context). Classical data stream analysis are biased towards vector or row data, where each attribute is independent to train an adaptive learning model, but rarely considers Time Series as a stream instance. Processing such type of data requires combining techniques in both communities of Time Series (TS) and Data Streams. To this end, by adopting the concepts of Shapelet and Matrix Profile, we conduct the first attempt to extract the adaptive features from Time Series Stream based on the Test-then-Train strategy, which is applicable in both contexts: a) under stable concept, learning model will be updated incrementally; b) for data source with Concept Drift, previous concepts that do not represent the current stream behavior will be discarded from the model. © 2019 IEEE.},

Concept drift adaptation is performed in an active manner, by dynamically combining base learners according to their recent performance using a non-linear function. Diversity in the ensembles is encouraged with several strategies that include heterogeneity among learners, sampling techniques and computation of summary statistics as extra predictors. Heterogeneity is used with the goal of better coping with different dynamic regimes of the time series. The driving hypotheses of this work are that (i) heterogeneous ensembles should better fit different dynamic regimes and (ii) dynamic aggregation should allow for fast detection and adaptation to regime changes. We extend some strategies typically used in classification tasks to time series forecasting. The proposed methods are validated using Monte Carlo simulations on 16 real-world univariate time series with numerical outcome as well as an artificial series with clear regime shifts. The results provide strong empirical evidence for our hypotheses. To encourage reproducibility the proposed method is publicly available as a software package. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Online anomaly detection of time-series data is an important and challenging task in machine learning. Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful and flexible models for modeling time-series data. However, the high time complexity of GPs limits their applications in online anomaly detection. Attributed to some internal or external changes, concept drift usually occurs in time-series data, where the characteristics of data and meanings of abnormal behaviors alter over time. Online anomaly detection methods should have the ability to adapt to concept drift. Motivated by the above facts, this paper proposes the method of sparse Gaussian processes with Q-function (SGP-Q). The SGP-Q employs sparse Gaussian processes (SGPs) whose time complexity is lower than that of GPs, thus significantly speeding up online anomaly detection. By using Q-function properly, the SGP-Q can adapt to concept drift well. Moreover, the SGP-Q makes use of few abnormal data in the training data by its strategy of updating training data, resulting in more accurate sparse Gaussian process regression models and better anomaly detection results. We evaluate the SGP-Q on various artificial and real-world datasets. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the SGP-Q. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper presents and analyzes an incremental system for clustering streaming time series. The Online Divisive-Agglomerative Clustering (ODAC) system continuously maintains a tree-like hierarchy of clusters that evolves with data, using a top-down strategy. The splitting criterion is a correlation-based dissimilarity measure among time series, splitting each node by the farthest pair of streams. The system also uses a merge operator that reaggregates a previously split node in order to react to changes in the correlation structure between time series. The split and merge operators are triggered in response to changes in the diameters of existing clusters, assuming that in stationary environments, expanding the structure leads to a decrease in the diameters of the clusters. The system is designed to process thousands of data streams that flow at a high rate. The main features of the system include update time and memory consumption that do not depend on the number of examples in the stream. Moreover, the time and memory required to process an example decreases whenever the cluster structure expands. Experimental results on artificial and real data assess the processing qualities of the system, suggesting a competitive performance on clustering streaming time series, exploring also its ability to deal with concept drift. © 2007 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Massive data broadcast by GPS-equipped vehicles provide unprecedented opportunities. One of the main tasks in order to optimize our transportation networks is to build data-driven real-time decision support systems. However, the dynamic environments where the networks operate disallow the traditional assumptions required to put in practice many off-the-shelf supervised learning algorithms, such as finite training sets or stationary distributions. In this paper, we propose BRIGHT: a drift-aware supervised learning framework to predict demand quantities. BRIGHT aims to provide accurate predictions for short-term horizons through a creative ensemble of time series analysis methods that handles distinct types of concept drift. By selecting neighborhoods dynamically, BRIGHT reduces the likelihood of overfitting. By ensuring diversity among the base learners, BRIGHT ensures a high reduction of variance while keeping bias stable. Experiments were conducted using three large-scale heterogeneous real-world transportation networks in Porto (Portugal), Shanghai (China), and Stockholm (Sweden), as well as with controlled experiments using synthetic data where multiple distinct drifts were artificially induced. The obtained results illustrate the advantages of BRIGHT in relation to state-of-the-art methods for this task. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Financial markets are very important to the economical and social organization of modern society. Due to they importance, several researchers have investigated how to predict future market movements by using both statistical and soft computing methods based on historical time series data. However, as a typical data stream, financial time series frequently present concept drift, which is a change in the relationship between input data and the target variable over time. The concept drift phenomenon affects negatively the forecasting accuracy since the learned model becomes outdated after a change in the current concept. In this paper we investigate how to handle concept drift in financial time series prediction in order to improve the forecasting accuracy. Two explicit drift detector mechanisms, namely the Drift Detection Mechanism (DDM) and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average for Concept Drift Detection Mechanism (ECDD), were investigated. The main contribution of this work is an approach that combines Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELM) with explicit drift detection, in which the OS-ELM updates the decision model just in the presence of concept drift in data. Experimental results showed that the use of drift detection was able to speed up the prediction time of OS-ELM maintaining equivalent accuracy. © 2015 IEEE.},

Real world applications are often streaming and their measurements are often sampled after an extended period of time thereby giving rise to the formation of a time series. Measurement devices assigned to measure nonstationary quantities are subject to failure. When a failure occurs, the process of approximating missing values becomes difficulty. The process of approximating missing values in such dynamic environments is further exacerbated by the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the evolving data. Typical examples include stock market, network intrusion detection systems and seismic waves. To estimate missing values with traditional statistical methods can lead to bias when applied to environments that evolve with time. This paper introduces an ensemble of regressors approach to approximate missing data in online nonstationary data. The approach learns new concepts incrementally and the current learnt concept is then used to approximate the missing values. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The efforts of the European Union (EU) in the energy supply domain aim to introduce intelligent grid management across the whole of the EU. The target intelligent grid is planned to contain 80% of all meters to be smart meters generating data every 15 minutes. Thus, the energy data of EU will grow rapidly in the very near future. Smart meters are successively installed in a phased roll-out, and the first smart meter data samples are ready for different types of analysis in order to understand the data, to make precise predictions and to support intelligent grid control. In this paper, we propose an incremental heterogeneous ensemble model for time series prediction. The model was designed to make predictions for electricity load time series taking into account their inherent characteristics, such as seasonal dependency and concept drift. The proposed ensemble model characteristics – robustness, natural ability to parallelize and the ability to incrementally train the model – make the presented ensemble suitable for processing streams of data in a “big data” environment. © 2016, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

	abstract = {This paper presents a time series whole clustering system that incrementally constructs a tree-like hierarchy of clusters, using a top-down strategy. The Online Divisive-Agglomerative Clustering (ODAC) system uses a correlation-based dissimilarity measure between time series over a data stream and possesses an agglomerative phase to enhance a dynamic behavior capable of concept drift detection. Main features include splitting and agglomerative criteria based on the diameters of existing clusters and supported by a significance level. At each new example, only the leaves are updated, reducing computation of unneeded dissimilarities and speeding up the process every time the structure grows. Experimental results on artificial and real data suggest competitive performance on clustering time series and show that the system is equivalent to a batch divisive clustering on stationary time series, being also capable of dealing with concept drift. With this work, we assure the possibility and importance of hierarchical incremental time series whole clustering in the data stream paradigm, presenting a valuable and usable option.},

	abstract = {Multispectral image classification has long been the domain of static learning with nonstationary input data assumption. The prevalence of Industrial Revolution 4.0 has led to the emergence to perform real-time analysis (classification) in an online learning scenario. Due to the complexities (spatial, spectral, dynamic data sources, and temporal inconsistencies) in online and time-series multispectral image analysis, there is a high occurrence probability in variations of spectral bands from an input stream, which deteriorates the classification performance (in terms of accuracy) or makes them ineffective. To highlight this critical issue, firstly, this study formulates the problem of new spectral band arrival as virtual concept drift. Secondly, an adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble framework is proposed and evaluated for a new spectral band adaptation. The adaptive CNN ensemble framework consists of five (05) modules, including dynamic ensemble classifier (DEC) module. DEC uses the weighted voting ensemble approach using multiple optimized CNN instances. DEC module can increase dynamically after new spectral band arrival. The proposed ensemble approach in the DEC module (individual spectral band handling by the individual classifier of the ensemble) contributes the diversity to the ensemble system in the simple yet effective manner. The results have shown the effectiveness and proven the diversity of the proposed framework to adapt the new spectral band during online image classification. Moreover, the extensive training dataset, proper regularization, optimized hyperparameters (model and training), and more appropriate CNN architecture significantly contributed to retaining the performance accuracy. © 2020 Syed Muslim Jameel et al.},

	abstract = {As one of promising renewable energy, wind energy has an important position in the field of energy market and it has been always used to generate electricity, thus, the high precision wind speed forecasting is important but challenging for power generation system. Many researchers have devoted their attention to establish efficient wind speed forecasting models, limited by the structure of original models and database, these models could not solve overfitting problem very well and it is rare that a single wind speed forecasting model is always best in all cases since each model has its own particular strengths and weaknesses. The combining method, composed of multiple forecasting models, is regarded as a type of outstanding approach to take advantage of strengths of each model. However, the properties of the individual forecasting models may vary over time, which leads to poorly performance of the combining method using fixed weights, thus, it is more appropriate to allow the combining weights to change according to the time-varying underlying process. This study develops a reliable combination model for wind speed forecasting based on an improved Adaboost algorithm named time-vary-forecasting-effectiveness (TW-FE-Adaboost) algorithm in order to improve the overall forecasting accuracy. In the proposed model, concept drift is firstly used to deal with wind speed time series mainly because the contributions of samples which are varying with time, the second order forecasting effectiveness is used to measure the performance of weak learners. Then, the multi-step ahead forecasting for each site is conducted using TW-FE-Adaboost model in which the input-output sample pairs are determined in a reasonable way. Finally, the ultimate forecast result of wind speed is obtained by aggregating the forecast result of each weak learner. The proposed model is tested using four sites wind speed series collected in Hexi corridor from wind farms located in northwest of China. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms all other comparison models in this paper, which demonstrates that the proposed model has superior performances for wind speed forecasting. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This work focuses on classification over time series data. When a time series is generated by non-stationary phenomena, the pattern relating the series with the class to be predicted may evolve over time (concept drift). Consequently, predictive models aimed to learn this pattern may become eventually obsolete, hence failing to sustain performance levels of practical use. To overcome this model degradation, online learning methods incrementally learn from new data samples arriving over time, and accommodate eventual changes along the data stream by implementing assorted concept drift strategies. In this manuscript we elaborate on the suitability of online learning methods to predict the road congestion level based on traffic speed time series data. We draw interesting insights on the performance degradation when the forecasting horizon is increased. As opposed to what is done in most literature, we provide evidence of the importance of assessing the distribution of classes over time before designing and tuning the learning model. This previous exercise may give a hint of the predictability of the different congestion levels under target. Experimental results are discussed over real traffic speed data captured by inductive loops deployed over Seattle (USA). Several online learning methods are analyzed, from traditional incremental learning algorithms to more elaborated deep learning models. As shown by the reported results, when increasing the prediction horizon, the performance of all models degrade severely due to the distribution of classes along time, which supports our claim about the importance of analyzing this distribution prior to the design of the model. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We approach the time-series forecasting problem in the presence of concept drift by automatic learning rate tuning of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The SGD-based approach is preferable to other concept drift algorithms in that it can be applied to any model and it can keep learning efficiently whilst predicting online. Among a number of SGD algorithms, the variance-based SGD (vSGD) can successfully handle concept drift by automatic learning rate tuning, which is reduced to an adaptive mean estimation problem. However, its performance is still limited because of its heuristic mean estimator. In this paper, we present a concept-drift-aware stochastic gradient descent (Cogra), equipped with more theoretically-sound mean estimator called sequential mean tracker (SMT). Our key contribution is that we define a goodness criterion for the mean estimators; SMT is designed to be optimal according to this criterion. As a result of comprehensive experiments, we find that (i) our SMT can estimate the mean better than vSGD's estimator in the presence of concept drift, and (ii) in terms of predictive performance, Cogra reduces the predictive loss by 16-67% for real-world datasets, indicating that SMT improves the prediction accuracy significantly. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).},

As the discussion topics and user opinions on those topics change drastically with time, those streams undergo changes in data distribution, leading to changes in the concept to be learned, a phenomenon called concept drift. One particular type of drift, that has not yet attracted a lot of attention is feature drift, i.e., changes in the features that are relevant for the learning task at hand. In this work, we propose an approach for handling feature drifts in textual streams. Our approach integrates i) an ensemble-based mechanism to accurately predict the feature/word values for the next time-point by taking into account the different features might be subject to different temporal trends and ii) a sketch-based feature space maintenance mechanism that allows for a memory-bounded maintenance of the feature space over the stream.

	abstract = {Single-molecule sensors record molecular dynamics in the form of time series representing a stochastic trajectory in the space of molecular conformational states. One of the main challenges in modeling this trajectory is to suppress the sensor baseline drift, especially in high-throughput and long acquisitions that are characteristic of single-molecule field-effect transistor sensors (smFETs). In this work, a multiscale signal compression technique based on the minimum description length principle, combined with an adaptive piece-wise cubic interpolation, is implemented to address the problem of baseline modeling through a blind source separation framework. Tests on simulated single-molecule traces over a large space of parameters (kinetics, noise, drift) show that the proposed algorithm accurately estimates the sensor baseline, including for signals with high and mixed noises, concept drifts, and various shapes and rates of baseline drifts, without prior knowledge of the sensor parameters or molecular kinetics. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Time series anomaly detection is essential because it helps in identifying faulty sensors and malicious behaviour in real-time. Most of the research work on anomaly detection revolves around density-based unsupervised learning techniques for batch data and forecasting (threshold-based) techniques for streaming data. Typically in streaming data, we continuously encounter concept drifts due to which the forecasting approaches’ threshold becomes insignificant with time. Also, forecasting techniques cannot identify sequential anomalies, as they try to forecast as per the ingested data. The reason behind less implementations using supervised learning for anomaly detection is because of the class imbalance problem in the dataset and unavailability of the labels. Most of the anomaly datasets contain 5% outliers due to which any learning model will overfit on normal data class and will not be able to learn about the anomalous class. In this work, we address these issues using Prioritized Experience Replay and introduce a novel state function which incorporates feedback to identify sequential anomalies. We evaluate our model on the Yahoo benchmark dataset, which contains 367 time-series datasets (each testing different aspects of anomaly detection), four smart home energy datasets and Numenta Anomaly benchmark datasets consisting of 58 time series data. The paper exhibits better performance of the proposed approach over the baseline approaches across different anomaly datasets. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

According to the concept drift recognition results, the selected normal data were used to establish and train a DGE-based fault detection model and calculate the control limits of Hotelling-T2 and squared prediction error Q statistics. In the online fault detection stage, T2 and Q statistics of each test sample were calculated, and the fault samples were detected when their T2 or Q values exceeded the control limits. Two application examples on both Tennessee Eastman process and transformer dissolved gas analysis datasets illustrate that the cosine similarity and multiple linear regression models can effectively identify the concept drift in the data stream and select the appropriate training data for DGE model, in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of fault detection for industrial processes and power equipment. © 2020 Chin.

	abstract = {Energy efficiency and sustainability are important factors to address in the context of smart cities. In this sense, smart metering and nonintrusive load monitoring play a crucial role in fighting energy thefts and for optimizing the energy consumption of the home, building, city, and so forth. The estimated number of smart meters will exceed 800 million by 2020. By providing near real-time data about power consumption, smart meters can be used to analyze electricity usage trends and to point out anomalies guaranteeing companies' safety and avoiding energy wastes. In literature, there are many proposals approaching the problem of anomaly detection. Most of them are limited because they lack context and time awareness and the false positive rate is affected by the change in consumer habits. This research work focuses on the need to define anomaly detection method capable of facing the concept drift, for instance, family structure changes; a house becomes a second residence, and so forth. The proposed methodology adopts long short term memory network in order to profile and forecast the consumers' behavior based on their recent past consumptions. The continuous monitoring of the consumption prediction errors allows us to distinguish between possible anomalies and changes (drifts) in normal behavior that correspond to different error motifs. The experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed framework by pointing out an anomaly in a near real-time after a training period of one week. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics. © 2017 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper presents an approach to predictive modeling of sequentially arriving data, also known as a stream. Because of their unique properties, this kind of data requires different mining techniques. The ultimate limitations are the memory and the time. Since the number of records can be infinite, it is not possible to store them all in memory or read them more than once. Hence, the prediction method should work incrementally. Another important aspect of these data is that their characteristics change over time. The identification of the ongoing change in the monitored data sequence, also called 'concept drift', can significantly help to improve prediction accuracy by prediction model adaptation to the drifts. The challenge is to perform these model adaptations online. We have proposed an incremental adaptive method for time series prediction. Our approach is based on the adaptive learning scheme 'predict-diagnose-update'. The main concern was to find out whether our error-driven informed adaptation approach can equal the traditional blind adaptation approaches in accuracy and required resources such as time and memory. The results showed that informed adaptation can achieve comparable accuracy but uses less computational resources. We focused specifically on power demand forecasting but we showed that the approach is applicable also on time series with similar characteristics from other domains. © 2016 IEEE.},

Factor analyses and time series analyses show what types of accidents result in casualties, but the results from the analysis can become outdated. We propose a stream classification framework with drift detection to signal and adapt when the factors associated with crash casualties change over time. We propose a drift detection framework, G-mean Adaptive drift Detection (GAD), which adapts a classifier threshold to maximise G-mean. This metric rewards maximising accuracy on each class while keeping these accuracies balanced. As a result, GAD can make concept drift in the minority class easier to detect. We also propose a recurring concept classification framework, G-mean Concept Profiling Framework (GCPF), which reuses previously trained classifiers and uses GAD’s approach to drift detection. Through experimentation, we show GAD improves G-mean without increasing false positive drift detection on imbalanced synthetic and real world datasets. We also show GCPF achieves better G-mean than other state-of-the-art stream classification approaches on the NZ crash data set. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

First of all, the recentness biased learning method is derived by minimizing the forecasting risk based on a priori probabilistic model where the latest sample is weighted most. Secondly, the recentness biased learning method is implemented with an autoregressive process and the multi-layer feed-forward neural networks. The experimental results have been discussed and analyzed in detail for two typical databases.

	abstract = {Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) offers the possibility to build up large-scale metal parts. Data which is obtained from a multivariate sensor system in-situ must be analyzed automatically to ensure an early and reliable detection of defects to reduce the costs due to production scrap. For that reason, a modular anomaly detector for multivariate time series in WAAM was investigated in this paper. The approach adressed major topics in real-life data sets of industrial applications such as miscellaneous signal sample rates, lack of synchronization and concept drift. A reference data set based on an anomaly-dependently splitted time horizon was defined to reduce the sensitivity loss of the detector after an anomaly. To avoid the need for labeled data, an unsupervised anomaly detection method based on neural networks was used. Hence, no time and costs for artificial defect creation on the machine tool are required when implementing the approach in industrial applications. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is the mainstay for text classification. However, even the most successful techniques are defeated by many real-world applications that have a strong time-varying component. To advance research on this challenging but important problem, we promote a natural, experimental framework - the Daily Classification Task - which can be applied to large time-based datasets, such as Reuters RCV1. In this paper we dissect concept drift into three main subtypes. We demonstrate via a novel visualization that the recurrent themes subtype is present in RCV1. This understanding led us to develop a new learning model that transfers induced knowledge through time to benefit future classifier learning tasks. The method avoids two main problems with existing work in inductive transfer: scalability and the risk of negative transfer. In empirical tests, it consistently showed more than 10 points F-measure improvement for each of four Reuters categories tested. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in sensor technology have made it possible to collect enormous amounts of data in real time. However, because of the sheer volume of data most of it will never be inspected by an algorithm, much less a human being. One way to mitigate this problem is to perform some type of anomaly (novelty / interestingness/ surprisingness) detection and flag unusual patterns for further inspection by humans or more CPU intensive algorithms. Most current solutions are "custom made" for particular domains, such as ECG monitoring, valve pressure monitoring, etc. This customization requires extensive effort by domain expert. Furthermore, handcrafted systems tend to be very brittle to concept drift. In this demonstration, we will show an online anomaly detection system that does not need to be customized for individual domains, yet performs with exceptionally high precision/recall. The system is based on the recently introduced idea of time series bitmaps. To demonstrate the universality of our system, we will allow testing on independently annotated datasets from domains as diverse as ECGs, Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, video surveillance, and respiratory data. In addition, we invite attendees to test our system with any dataset available on the web.},

	abstract = {Time series arise in many fields of science such as engineering, economy and agriculture to cite a few. In the early 1990’s the so called Fuzzy Time Series were proposed to handle vague and imprecise knowledge in time series data and have since become competitive forecasting models. A common limitation of recent fuzzy time series models is their inability to handle non-stationary data. Thus, in this paper we introduce a Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series (NSFTS). In the proposed method, we employ Non-Stationary Fuzzy Sets, in which perturbation functions are used to adapt the membership function parameters in the knowledge base in response to statistical changes in the time series. The flexibility of the method by means of computational experiments was tested with eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several kinds of concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ, SP500 and TAIEX), three real FOREX pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, GBP-USD), and two real cryptocoins exchange rates (Bitcoin-USD and Ethereum-USD). As competitor models the Time Variant fuzzy time series and the Incremental Ensemble were used, these are two of the major approaches for handling non-stationary data sets. The proposed method shows resilience to concept drift, by adapting parameters of the model, while preserving the symbolic structure of the knowledge base. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Time series outlier detection is an important topic in data mining, having significant applications in reality. Due to the complexity and dynamics of time series, it is quite difficult to detect outlier in time series. Particularly, influenced by outside factors, time series are usually unpredictable, accompanied with concept drift. Recently, recurrent neural network has been used to identify time series outlier, and demonstrated great potential. However, RNN usually uses deterministic state transition structure, which cannot characterize the variability of high-dimensional time series. This paper proposes to incorporate latent variables into RNN, aiming to catch the time series variability as much as possible. In particular, our method combines RNN and variation auto-encoder framework. We evaluate our method with several real datasets, and demonstrate that our method has superior detecting performance.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the use of multi-objective ensemble learning to monitor drinking-water quality. Such problem consists of a data set with an extreme imbalance ratio where the events, the minority class, must be correctly detected given a time series denoting water quality and operative data on a minutely basis. First, the given data set is preprocessed for imputing missing data, adjusting concept drift and adding new statistical features, such as moving average, moving standard deviation, moving maximum and moving minimum. Next, two ensemble learning techniques are used, namely SMOTEBoost and RUSBoost. Such techniques have been developed specifically for dealing with imbalanced data, where the base learners are trained by adjusting the ratio between the classes. The first algorithm focuses on oversampling the minority class, while the second focuses on under-sampling the majority class. Finally, multiobjective optimisation is used for pruning the base models of such ensembles in order to maximise the prediction score without reducing generalisation performance. In the training phase, the model is trained, optimised and evaluated using hold-out validation on a given training data set. At the end, the trained model is inserted into a framework, which is used for online event detection and assessing the model's performance. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Several real-world dynamic processes can be modeled as a time series, such as stock price movements, exchange rates, temperatures, among others. As a special kind of data stream, a time series may present concept drift, which affects negatively time series analysis and forecasting. Explicit drift detection methods based on monitoring the time series features may provide a better understanding of how concepts evolve over time than methods based on monitoring the forecasting error of a base predictor. In this paper, we propose an online explicit drift detection method that identifies concept drifts in time series by monitoring time series features, called Feature Extraction for Explicit Concept Drift Detection (FEDD). Computational experiments showed that FEDD performed better than error-based approaches in several linear and nonlinear artificial time series with abrupt and gradual concept drifts. © 2016 IEEE.},

Meta-cognitive learning strategy decides when the incoming data needs to be updated, retrained, or discarded during learning and automatically finding ALD threshold that reduces the learning time of prediction model.

	abstract = {In marine research, image data sets from the same area but collected at different times allow seafloor fauna communities to be monitored over time. However, ongoing technological developments have led to the use of different imaging systems and deployment strategies. Thus, instances of the same class exhibit slightly shifted visual features in images taken at slightly different locations or with different gear. These shifts are referred to as concept drift in the domains computational image analysis and machine learning as this phenomenon poses particular challenges for these fields. In this paper, we analyse four different data sets from an area in the Peru Basin and show how changes in imaging parameters affect the classification of 12 megafauna morphotypes with a 34-layer ResNet. Images were captured using the ocean floor observation system, a traditional sled-based system, or an autonomous underwater vehicle, which is used as an imaging platform capable of surveying larger regions. ResNet applied on separate individual data sets, i.e., without concept drift, showed that changing object distance was less important than the amount of training data. The results for the image data acquired with the ocean floor observation system showed higher performance values than data collected with the autonomous underwater vehicle. The results from this concept drift studies indicate that collecting image data from many dives with slightly different gear may result in training data well-suited for learning taxonomic classification tasks and that data volume can compensate for light concept drift. © Copyright © 2020 Langenkämper, van Kevelaer, Purser and Nattkemper.},

	abstract = {Machine leaning (ML) models must be accurate to produce quality AI solutions. There must be high accuracy in the data and with the model that is built using the data. Online machine learning algorithms fits naturally with use cases that involves time series data. In online environments the data distribution can change over time producing what is known as concept drift. Real-life, real-time, machine learning algorithms operating in dynamic environments must be able to detect any drift or changes in the data distribution and adapt and update the ML model in the face of data that changes over time. In this paper we present the work of a simulated drift added to time series ML models. We simulate drift on Multiplayer perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Results show ML models with flavors of recurrent neural network (RNN) are less sensitive to drift compared to other models. By adding noise to the training set, we can recover accuracy of the model in the face of drift. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Data stream mining has been receiving increased attention due to its presence in a wide range of applications, such as sensor networks, banking, and telecommunication. One of the most important challenges during learning from data streams is reacting to concept drift, i.e. unforeseen changes of the stream's underlying data distribution. Traditional methods always used online learning to handle the concept drift problem. However, online learning requires high time cost during online training. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a Kalman filtering approach, which can provide robust concept drift detection, to track concept drift. Once concept drift happens, the online extreme learning machine is applied to update the tracking model, whereas the offline extreme learning machine is used when no concept drift occurs. Based on this idea, we propose a fusion framework to combine online and offline extreme learning machine to efficiently track the data stream. The experiment results indicate the superior performance of our method. © 2016 IEEE.},

Recurrent multi-step algorithm is applied to release the limitation in the number of prediction steps, and Drift Detector Mechanism (DDM) is used to overcome the problem of concept drift in the prediction model. The new meta-cognitive strategy decides the way of the incoming data during training, which decreases the training computation of prediction model and solves the parameter dependency. In our evaluation, we use a total of six artificial data sets and three real-world data sets (Standard & Poor's 500 Index, Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index, and Ozone Concentration in Toronto) to prove the ability of kernel filters, the detecting ability of concept drift detector, and situation of applying meta-cognitive strategy in our proposed model.

An important aspect in TS analysis is Time Series Classification (TSC), which has been applied in medical diagnosis, human activity recognition, industrial troubleshooting, etc. Typically, all TSC work trains a stable model from an off-line TS dataset, without considering potential Concept Drift in streaming context. Conventional data stream is considered as independent examples (e.g., row data) coming in real-time, but rarely considers Time Series with real-valued data coming in a sequential order, called Time Series Stream. Processing such type of data, requires combining techniques in both communities of Time Series (TS) and Data Streams. To facilitate the users’ understanding of this combination, we propose ISETS, a web-based application which allows users to monitor the evolution of interpretable features in Time Series Stream. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {Time series forecasting is a problem with many applications. However, in many domains, such as stock market, the underlying generating process of the time series observations may change, making forecasting models obsolete. This problem is known as Concept Drift. Approaches for time series forecasting should be able to detect and react to concept drift in a timely manner, so that the forecasting model can be updated as soon as possible. Despite the fact that the concept drift problem is well investigated in the literature, little effort has been made to solve this problem for time series forecasting so far. This work proposes two novel methods for dealing with the time series forecasting problem in the presence of concept drift. The proposed methods benefit from the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to detect and react to concept drifts in the time series data stream. It is expected that the use of collective intelligence of PSO makes the proposed method more robust to false positive drift detections while maintaining a low error rate on the forecasting task. Experiments show that the methods achieved competitive results in comparison to state-of-The-Art methods. © 2017 IEEE.},

The common approach of training one model in an offline manner using historical data is likely to fail under dynamically changing and non-stationary environments where the definition of normal behavior changes over time making the model irrelevant and ineffective. In this paper, we describe a temporal model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time series anomaly detection to address challenges posed by sudden or regular changes in normal behavior. The model is trained incrementally as new data becomes available, and is capable of adapting to the changes in the data distribution. RNN is used to make multi-step predictions of the time series, and the prediction errors are used to update the RNN model as well as detect anomalies and change points. Large prediction error is used to indicate anomalous behavior or a change (drift) in normal behavior. Further, the prediction errors are also used to update the RNN model in such a way that short term anomalies or outliers do not lead to a drastic change in the model parameters whereas high prediction errors over a period of time lead to significant updates in the model parameters such that the model rapidly adapts to the new norm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a diverse set of synthetic, publicly available and proprietary real-world datasets. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Traffic congestion is a major problem on today's urban mobility. This paper introduces a novel model for Automatic Incident Prediction (AID) on freeways: Drift3Flow. This stepwise methodology produces flow/occupancy rate predictions using an online weighted ensemble schema of two well-known time series analysis techniques: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (ETS). Then, it continuously monitors the probability distribution function (p.d.f.) of the prediction residuals to trigger alarms of an imminent prediction divergence, i.e. concept drift. Such alarm activates an update neuron which extends our model's reactivity by embedding a fully incremental learning schema inspired on the Delta Rule (DR) (derived from the BackPropagation (BP) algorithm). Our experimental test-bed used three weeks of data acquired from a real-world sensor network in Asia. The results validated its contributions by exhibiting a superior performance: 25% greater than the one obtained using ARIMA and ETS-based AID methods. © 2015 IEEE.},

Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known for their state-of-the-art performance in image classification, they present drawbacks when used to analyze different data types, such as time series. In this paper, we propose the Sequential Mask Convolutional Neural Network (SMCNN), a method that overcomes such drawbacks, and leverages CNNs for sequential data analysis. Our method transforms sequential data into an image representation by means of a specialized filter that produces flexible shape forms, and detects multiple types of outliers simultaneously. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on data containing a variety of anomaly types combined with different concept drifts. The solution shows to significantly outperform prior endeavors and to provide high generalization capabilities on a wide array of data characteristics. We attribute its success to its ability to pinpoint the exact location of patterns and anomalies in parallel and to the invariance of CNNs, which allows them to adapt seamlessly to concept drifts. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rough set-based pseudo outer-product fuzzy neural network (RSPOP FNN) is a member of the pseudo outer-product (POP) FNN family known for high accuracy and interpretability. The POP algorithm utilizes a one-pass rule identification and generation process and rough set theory to perform attribute and rule reduction, hence, producing highly interpretable if-then fuzzy rules while maintaining a high level of accuracy. However, non-incremental systems are heavily dependant on the quality and quantity of the training set, an issue especially prominent in time series data. The robustness of RSPOP FNN is improved using an adapted form of discrete incremental clustering (DIC), an incremental learning algorithm. This renders the system immune to deficiencies in the training set. Issues with the incremental rough set attribute reduction are also addressed using an adapted form of Learn++ Non-Stationary Environments (Learn++.NSE), a form of ensemble learning strong in datasets with the concept drift phenomenon. This is often found in time series data. The proposed system has been extensively benchmarked in traffic flow prediction, real life stock price and volatility predictions. The results show the strength of the online systems against offline systems. The promising results demonstrated the benefit of incremental learning in the accuracy and adaptability of its time series prediction ability. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {IT companies need to monitor various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and detect anomalies in real time to ensure the quality and reliability of Internet-based services. However, due to the diversity of KPIs, the ambiguity and scarcity of anomalies and the lack of labels, anomaly detection for various KPIs has been a great challenge. Existing KPI anomaly detection methods have not explored the properties of anomalies in KPIs in detail to our best knowledge. Therefore, we explore anomalies in KPIs and recognize a common and important form of anomalies named abrupt changes, which often indicate potential failures in the relevant services. For abrupt changes in various KPIs, we propose DDCOL, an unsupervised online anomaly detection algorithm with parameter adaptation from the perspective of anomalies for the first time. We propose three techniques: high order {D} ifference extraction and combination, {D} ensity-based {C} lustering with parameter adaptation and {O}\text{n}{L} ine detection with subsampling (DDCOL). Compared with traditional statistical methods and unsupervised learning methods, extensive experimental results and analysis on a large number of public KPIs show the competitive performance of DDCOL and the significance of abrupt changes. Furthermore, we provide an interpretation for the promising results, which shows that DDCOL can be robust to KPI expected concept drifts, and obtain a good feature distribution of normal data in KPIs.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Extensive research on time series classification in the last decade has produced fast and accurate algorithms for the single-dimensional case. However, the increasing prevalence of inexpensive sensors has reinforced the need for algorithms to handle multi-dimensional time series. For example, modern smartphones have at least a dozen sensors capable of producing streaming time series, and hospital-based (and increasingly, home-based) medical devices can produce time series streams from more than twenty sensors. The two most common ways to generalize from single to multi-dimensional data are to use all the streams or just the single best stream as determined at training time. However, as we show here, both approaches can be very brittle. Moreover, neither approach exploits the observation that different sensors may be considered "experts" on different classes. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for multi-dimensional time series classification that weights the class prediction from each time series stream. These weights are based not only on each stream's previous track record on the class it is currently predicting, but also on the distance from the unlabeled object. As we demonstrate with extensive experiments on real data, our method is more accurate than current approaches and particularly robust in the face of concept drift or sensor noise. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a framework that provides early detection of anomalous series within a large collection of nonstationary streaming time-series data. We define an anomaly as an observation, that is, very unlikely given the recent distribution of a given system. The proposed framework first calculates a boundary for the system’s typical behavior using extreme value theory. Then a sliding window is used to test for anomalous series within a newly arrived collection of series. The model uses time series features as inputs, and a density-based comparison to detect any significant changes in the distribution of the features. Using various synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate the wide applicability and usefulness of our proposed framework. We show that the proposed algorithm can work well in the presence of noisy nonstationarity data within multiple classes of time series.

A broad selection of efficient learning algorithms exists which may be applied to data streams, but they typically do not take into account the temporal nature of the data. We motivate and design a method which creates an efficient representation of a data stream, where temporal information is embedded into each instance via the error space of forecasting models. Unlike many other methods in the literature, our approach can be rapidly initialized and does not require iterations over the full data sequence, thus it is suitable for a streaming scenario. This allows the application of off-the-shelf data-stream methods, depending on the application domain. In this paper, we investigate classification. We compare to a large variety of methods (auto-encoders, HMMs, basis functions, clustering methodologies, and PCA) and find that our proposed methods perform very competitively, and offers much promise for future work. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},
