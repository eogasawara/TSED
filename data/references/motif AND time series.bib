	abstract = {Time series analysis is an important research topic and a key step in monitoring and predicting events in many fields. Recently, the Matrix Profile method, and particularly two of its Euclidean-distance-based implementations—SCRIMP and SCAMP—have become the state-of-the-art approaches in this field. Those algorithms bring the possibility of obtaining exact motifs and discords from a time series, which can be used to infer events, predict outcomes, detect anomalies and more. While matrix profile is embarrassingly parallelizable, we find that auto-vectorization techniques fail to fully exploit the SIMD capabilities of modern CPU architectures. In this paper, we develop custom-vectorized SCRIMP and SCAMP implementations based on AVX2 and AVX-512 extensions, which we combine with multithreading techniques aimed at exploiting the potential of the underneath architectures. Our experimental evaluation, conducted using real data, shows a performance improvement of more than 4× with respect to the auto-vectorization. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an upsurge in the spread of diverse conspiracy theories (CTs) with real-life impact. However, the dynamics of user engagement remain under-researched. In the present study, we leverage Twitter data across 11 months in 2020 from the timelines of 109 CT posters and a comparison group (non-CT group) of equal size. Within this approach, we used word embeddings to distinguish non-CT content from CT-related content as well as analysed which element of CT content emerged in the pandemic. Subsequently, we applied time series analyses on the aggregate and individual level to investigate whether there is a difference between CT posters and non-CT posters in non-CT tweets as well as the temporal dynamics of CT tweets. In this regard, we provide a description of the aggregate and individual series, conducted a STL decomposition in trends, seasons, and errors, as well as an autocorrelation analysis, and applied generalised additive mixed models to analyse nonlinear trends and their differences across users. The narrative motifs, characterised by word embeddings, address pandemic-specific motifs alongside broader motifs and can be related to several psychological needs (epistemic, existential, or social). Overall, the comparison of the CT group and non-CT group showed a substantially higher level of overall COVID-19-related tweets in the non-CT group and higher level of random fluctuations. Focussing on conspiracy tweets, we found a slight positive trend but, more importantly, an increase in users in 2020. Moreover, the aggregate series of CT content revealed two breaks in 2020 and a significant albeit weak positive trend since June. On the individual level, the series showed strong differences in temporal dynamics and a high degree of randomness and day-specific sensitivity. The results stress the importance of Twitter as a means of communication during the pandemic and illustrate that these beliefs travel very fast and are quickly endorsed. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The convergence of advanced single-cell in vivo functional imaging techniques, computational modelling tools and graph-based network analytics has heralded new opportunities to study single-cell dynamics across large-scale networks, providing novel insights into principles of brain communication and pointing towards potential new strategies for treating neurological disorders. A major recent finding has been the identification of unusually richly connected hub cells that have capacity to synchronize networks and may also be critical in network dysfunction. While hub neurons are traditionally defined by measures that consider solely the number and strength of connections, novel higher-order graph analytics now enables the mining of massive networks for repeating subgraph patterns called motifs. As an illustration of the power offered by higher-order analysis of neuronal networks, we highlight how recent methodological advances uncovered a new functional cell type, the superhub, that is predicted to play a major role in regulating network dynamics. Finally, we discuss open questions that will be critical for assessing the importance of higher-order cellular-scale network analytics in understanding brain function in health and disease.

It is the case for environmental monitoring where it is question to detect radiological phenomena from environmental signals. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised and unknown length motif discovery method based on the Matrix Profile with a low computational cost. Its performance is evaluated on a dataset of simulated radiological signals dedicated to environmental monitoring, and compared to a similarity DTW based method and to a classical standard deviation based method.

	abstract = {Arbovirus can cause diseases with a broad spectrum from mild to severe and long-lasting symptoms, affecting humans worldwide and therefore considered a public health problem with global and diverse socio-economic impacts. Understanding how they spread within and across different regions is necessary to devise strategies to control and prevent new outbreaks. Complex network approaches have widespread use to get important insights on several phenomena, as the spread of these viruses within a given region. This work uses the motif-synchronization methodology to build time varying complex networks based on data of registered infections caused by Zika, chikungunya, and dengue virus from 2014 to 2020, in 417 cities of the state of Bahia, Brazil. The resulting network sets capture new information on the spread of the diseases that are related to the time delay in the synchronization of the time series among different municipalities. Thus the work adds new and important network-based insights to previous results based on dengue dataset in the period 2001–2016. The most frequent synchronization delay time between time series in different cities, which control the insertion of edges in the networks, ranges 7 to 14 days, a period that is compatible with the time of the individual-mosquito-individual transmission cycle of these diseases. As the used data covers the initial periods of the first Zika and chikungunya outbreaks, our analyses reveal an increasing monotonic dependence between distance among cities and the time delay for synchronization between the corresponding time series. The same behavior was not observed for dengue, first reported in the region back in 1986, either in the previously 2001–2016 based results or in the current work. These results show that, as the number of outbreaks accumulates, different strategies must be adopted to combat the dissemination of arbovirus infections. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Modern power systems are experiencing the challenge of high uncertainty with the increasing penetration of renewable energy resources and the electrification of heating systems. In this paradigm shift, understanding electricity users’ demand is of utmost value to the retailers, aggregators, and policymakers. However, behind-the-meter (BTM) equipment and appliances at the household level are unknown to the other stakeholders mainly due to privacy concerns and tight regulations. In this paper, we seek to identify residential consumers based on their BTM equipment, mainly rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and electric heating, using imported/purchased energy data from utility meters. To solve this problem with an interpretable, fast, secure, and maintainable solution, we propose an integrated method called Interpretable Refined Motifs And binary Classification (IRMAC). The proposed method comprises a novel shape-based pattern extraction technique, called Refined Motif (RM) discovery, and a single-neuron classifier. The first part extracts a sub-pattern from the long time series considering the frequency of occurrences, average dissimilarity, and time dynamics while emphasising specific times with annotated distances. The second part identifies users’ types with linear complexity while preserving the transparency of the algorithms. With the real data from Australia and Denmark, the proposed method is tested and verified in identifying PV owners and electrical heating system users. The performance of the IRMAC is studied and compared with various state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method reached an accuracy of 96% in identifying rooftop PV users and 94.4% in identifying electric heating users, which is comparable to the best solution based on deep learning, while the speed of the inference model is a thousand times faster. Last but not least, the proposed method is a transparent algorithm, which can tackle the concerns regarding the agnostic decision-making process when policies prohibit some machine learning methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Kink-turns are highly bent internal loop motifs commonly found in the ribosome and other RNA complexes. They frequently act as binding sites for proteins and mediate tertiary interactions in larger RNA structures. Kink-turns have been a topic of intense research, but their elastic properties in the folded state are still poorly understood. Here we use extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to parameterize a model of kink-turn in which the two flanking helical stems are represented by effective rigid bodies. Time series of the full set of six interhelical coordinates enable us to extract minimum energy shapes and harmonic stiffness constants for kink-turns from different RNA functional classes. The analysis suggests that kink-turns exhibit isotropic bending stiffness but are highly anisotropic with respect to lateral displacement of the stems. The most flexible lateral displacement mode is perpendicular to the plane of the static bend. These results may help understand the structural adaptation and mechanical signal transmission by kink-turns in complex natural and artificial RNA structures. © 2022 Biophysical Society},

	abstract = {Capturing long-term statistics of signals and time series is important for modeling recurrent phenomena, especially when such recurrences are a-periodic and can be characterized by the approximate repetition of variable length motifs, such as patterns in human gestures and trends in financial time series or musical melodies. Regressive and auto-regressive models that are common in such problems, both analytically derived and neural network-based, often suffer from limited memory or tend to accumulate errors, making them sensitive during training. Moreover, such models often assume stationary signal statistics, which makes it difficult to deal with switching regimes or conditional signal dynamics. In this paper, we describe a method for time series modeling that is based on adaptive symbolization that maximizes the predictive information of the resulting sequence. Using approximate string-matching methods, the initial vectorized sequence is quantized into a discrete representation with a variable quantization threshold. Finding an optimal signal embedding is formulated in terms of a predictive bottleneck problem that takes into account the trade-off between representation and prediction accuracy. Several downstream applications based on discrete representation are described in this paper, which includes an analysis of the symbolic dynamics of recurrence statistics, motif extraction, segmentation, query matching, and the estimation of transfer entropy between parallel signals. © 2022 by the author.},

	abstract = {Rolling bearing vibration signals exhibit typically complex modulation characteristics, and usually present nonstationary features. The defect of a rolling bearing is mainly manifested by impulses carried by resonance vibration, and the resonance frequency is independent of the operation conditions. Recent studies have correlated the characteristics of impulses with the fault severity of rolling bearings. However, the impulses are extracted manually, and the fault severity is evaluated by manually analyzing the target impulses or the matched atoms. This paper takes advantage of impulses, and proposes a novel intelligent rolling bearing fault severity recognition method. The method includes two modules, i.e., impulse mining and fault recognition. Recently, matrix profile (MP) has emerged as a promising method of mining the motifs in a time-domain signal. In the first module, MP is firstly introduced to the field of fault diagnosis, and it is conducted to mine the impulses from vibration signals. In the second module, convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with softmax regression is applied to automatically extract the discriminatory features from the mined impulses and accomplish the fault severity recognition. The proposed method is evaluated by the lab experimental bearing signals, and further validated by the signals collected from a wind turbine simulator with faulty high-speed shaft roller bearing. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can better recognize the fault severities of rolling bearings than the comparison methods.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

To improve the trust and transparency of AI-based systems, the EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) field has emerged. The XAI paradigm is bifurcated into two main categories: feature attribution and counterfactual explanation methods. While feature attribution methods are based on explaining the reason behind a model decision, counterfactual explanation methods discover the smallest input changes that will result in a different decision. In this paper, we aim at building trust and transparency in time series models by using motifs to generate counterfactual explanations. We propose Motif-Guided Counterfactual Explanation (MG-CF), a novel model that generates intuitive post-hoc counterfactual explanations that make full use of important motifs to provide interpretive information in decision-making processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that leverages motifs to guide the counterfactual explanation generation. We validated our model using five real-world time-series datasets from the UCR repository. Our experimental results show the superiority of MG-CF in balancing all the desirable counterfactual explanations properties in comparison with other competing state-of-the-art baselines. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Oomycetes, a large group of fungus-like organisms, include some destructive plant pathogens causing enormous economic damage. Phylogenetically, oomycetes belong to the kingdom Straminipila and have diverse lifestyles, including saprotrophs and both general and specialized pathogens of various eukaryotic supergroups. A rapid increase in genomic studies and next-generation sequencing technologies have led to significant progress in understanding oomycete lifestyles. However, their genetics, including transcriptional regulation, have been studied to a much lesser extent. Here, we provide a cross-species analysis of oomycete promoter for providing a first step towards elucidating gene regulation networks related to pathogenicity and life cycle stages. The clustered DNA sequences of Plasmopara halstedii transcriptome time-series expression level dataset from a preliminary study have been used as a core reference for cross-species comparisons. Using a computational pipeline, 46 potential transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs in 25 clusters with functionally conserved downstream genes of downy mildew and two Phytophthora species, regardless of the gene expression levels of Phytophthora transcriptomes, were found. This can now be followed up by knock-out experiments in oomycete species amenable for genetic modification. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have been carried out in recent years on the recognition, tracking, and discrimination of human activities. Automatic recognition of physical activities is often referred to as human activity recognition (HAR). There are generally vision-based and sensor-based approaches for activity recognition. The computer vision-based approach generally works well in laboratory conditions, but it can fail in real-world problems due to clutter, variable light intensity, and contrast. Sensor-based HAR systems are realized by continuously monitoring and analyzing physiological signals measured from heterogeneous sensors connected to the person's body. In this study, the Motif Patterns (MP) approach, which extracts features from sensor signals, is proposed for HAR. The success of the HAR systems depends on the effectiveness of the features extracted from the signals. The LSTM network is a special kind of recurrent neural network that has been used to make very successful predictions on time series data where long-term dependencies are. The LSTM network type offers a successful solution approach to solving long-term dependencies problems such as human activity recognition. The classification process was carried out with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) using MP features extracted from accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensor signals. A large dataset of 9120 signals was used to test the proposed approach. A high success rate of 98.42 % was achieved with the proposed MP + LSTM method. As a result, it has been seen that the proposed approach has been obtained with a high success rate for HAR using sensor signals. © 2022},

	abstract = {Studying the fluctuation characteristics of air traffic flow is the basis for designing efficient management and control strategies. Understanding the fluctuation characteristics of air traffic flow is conducive to the balance between airspace resource allocation and demand. In three time granularities, this paper uses the limited penetrable visibility graph method to build the complex network for the time series and explores the fluctuation characteristics of the flight flow with the k-core kernel algorithm from the overall perspective of the complex network, based on the time series of incoming flight traffic. The motif method is used to construct the sequence motif of the limited penetrable visibility graph, and the type conversion law of multivariate sequence motif is used to describe the dynamic transfer mode of traffic flow, so as to grasp the regular pattern of the dynamic evolution of flight traffic fluctuation. The method provides an effective tool for the prediction of fluctuation mode. It is found that: (1) In the network mapped by the limited penetrable visibility graph method, the k-core order of the node can effectively describe the fluctuation intensity of traffic flow, and has a positive correlative relationship with the fluctuation intensity. It means that the greater the k-core order of the node, the greater the fluctuation intensity, and the strong fluctuation period of arrival flight flow data of Tianjin airport is 16:50-17:30; (2) Although the longer the motif is, the more dynamic the motif can be, and the longer motif has no significance for the prediction of traffic flow under the influence of the chaotic characteristics of air traffic flow. For the research on the dynamic evolution of air traffic flow fluctuation, a 5-node motif is recommended. (3) The state transition diagram of fluctuation patterns can not only effectively describe the dynamic evolution of flow fluctuation, and it can also calculate the transition probability of fluctuation patterns. The transition probabilities under the three time granularities are 12.315%, 13.131%, and 10.638%, respectively. The state transition diagram provides an effective tool for the prediction of fluctuation patterns. © 2022 Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Synchronization phenomena on networks have attracted much attention in studies of neural, social, economic, and biological systems, yet we still lack a systematic understanding of how relative synchronizability relates to underlying network structure. Indeed, this question is of central importance to the key theme of how dynamics on networks relate to their structure more generally. We present an analytic technique to directly measure the relative synchronizability of noise-driven time-series processes on networks, in terms of the directed network structure. We consider both discrete-time autoregressive processes and continuous-time Ornstein–Uhlenbeck dynamics on networks, which can represent linearizations of nonlinear systems. Our technique builds on computation of the network covariance matrix in the space orthogonal to the synchronized state, enabling it to be more general than previous work in not requiring either symmetric (undirected) or diagonalizable connectivity matrices and allowing arbitrary self-link weights. More importantly, our approach quantifies the relative synchronization specifically in terms of the contribution of process motif (walk) structures. We demonstrate that in general the relative abundance of process motifs with convergent directed walks (including feedback and feedforward loops) hinders synchronizability. We also reveal subtle differences between the motifs involved for discrete or continuous-time dynamics. Our insights analytically explain several known general results regarding synchronizability of networks, including that small-world and regular networks are less synchronizable than random networks.

	abstract = {Axial piston pump is the key component of a hydraulic system. The reliability of the axial piston pump influences the reliability of the fluid power system directly. Discharge pressure signals are easy to obtain and can reflect the dynamic performance of the axial piston pump. Although many studies have been developed for fault diagnosis of the axial piston pump, most of these methods are based on supervised artificial intelligence-based methods that rely on massive labeled data. However, in practice application, the external load of the hydraulic system often varies and it is quite impractical or expensive to obtain massive labeled data. This article proposes a novel subsequence time series (STS) clustering-based unsupervised approach for anomaly detection of the axial piston pump using discharge pressure signal. The proposed approach comprises two stages: norm cluster search, and anomaly subsequence clustering. The proposed approach performs multiple STS clustering to search the norm cluster whose center can encode the time series better. The proposed approach comprises four modules: motif discovery, parameter-free minimum description length (MDL) clustering, subsequence search, and scoring the norm cluster. Subsequence search via dynamic time warping (DTW) enables the approach to discover the subsequences of variable length. In particular, weak fault signal detection is achieved by evaluating the local distribution of subsequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments under different external loads.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

We use regular expressions to construct the longest repeating sequences and sub-sequences that compose them, we then define these as motifs (which may or may not represent novel patterns).

A MECF-based unsupervised learning approach is applied in locating the source of the forced oscillation (FO), a periodic disturbance that detrimentally impacts power grids. Locating the FO source is imperative for system stability. Compared with the Fourier analysis, the MECF-based unsupervised learning is applicable under various FO situations, including the single FO, FO with resonance, and multiple concurrent FOs. The MECF-based unsupervised learning is a data-driven approach without any prior knowledge requirement of system models or typologies. Tests on the UK high-voltage transmission grid are conducted to validate the effectiveness of MECF-based unsupervised learning. In addition, the impacts of coupling strength and measurement noise on locating the FO source by the MECF-based unsupervised learning are investigated. Simulation results show that within typical ranges of coupling strength and measurement noise standard deviation of power systems, the MECF-based unsupervised learning is completely correct in locating the single FO, FO with resonance, and multiple concurrent FOs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Time series classification (TSC) has been one of the most fundamental problems of time series data. Time series shapelets (or simply, shapelets) are discriminative subsequences that have been recently found both effective and interpretable for solving TSC. However, shapelet discovery is known to be computationally costly. Meanwhile, matrix profile has been recently proposed for efficient motif discovery and anomaly detection. Our preliminary experiment shows that a direct adoption of the matrix profile on TSC does not bring superior classification accuracy. We have identified two main issues of such an adoption: 1) discords as 'shapelets', and 2) lack of shapelet diversity. In response to these issues, we propose instance profile for shapelets, called IPS, for shapelet discovery for TSC. The main challenge is to utilize the instance profile (IP) to capture the characteristics of shapelets in a robust manner and then to discover high-quality shapelets efficiently. First, we use our IP to generate abundant shapelet candidates. We next efficiently prune candidates that do not align with the definition of shapelets using a novel distribution-aware bloom filter (DABF). Three utility functions are proposed to measure the shapelet candidates and DABF is used to efficiently compute the functions. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on IPS with 12 competitive state-of-the-art methods using UCR Archive datasets. The efficiency is on average 25 times faster than that of BSPCOVER (the current state-of-the-art method). The accuracy of IPS is comparable to or higher than that of existing work. Furthermore, we select one case study to illustrate the interpretability of the shapelets.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Secondly, we study recurrent and statistically significant sub-graphs, i.e. network motifs, on the induced network backbone by means of null models which account for local node heterogeneity. The methodology is applied to analyze spillover networks of a set of global commodity prices. We demonstrate that spillovers become key drivers of the system variance during commodity price bubbles and bursts, giving raise to complex triadic structures which do not manifest during normal business periods. By accounting for local node connectivity, we observe a departure from the null models due to the high participation of Crude Oil, Food and Beverages and Raw Materials in complex recurrent sub-graphs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Most of Ciona's postural variance can be captured by 6 basic shapes, which we term "eigencionas."Motif analysis of postural time series revealed numerous stereotyped behavioral maneuvers including "startle-like"and "beat-and-glide."Employing computational modeling of swimming dynamics and spatiotemporal embedding of postural features revealed that behavioral differences are generated at the levels of motor modules and the transitions between, which may in part be modulated by bioamines. Finally, we show that flexible motor module usage gives rise to diverse behaviors in response to different light stimuli.  © 2022 Athira et al.

Oscillatory dynamics allowed for a greater variety of dynamical patterns for both mRNAs and proteins. Mathematical modeling of empirical data revealed three distinct mechanisms that decode p53 dynamics. Specific combinations of these mechanisms at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels enabled exclusive induction of proteins under particular dynamics.

	abstract = {We connect a common conventional value to quantify a recurrence plot with its motifs, which have recently been termed “recurrence triangles.” The common practical value we focus on is DET, which is the ratio of the points forming diagonal line segments of length 2 or longer within a recurrence plot. As a topological value, we use different recurrence triangles defined previously. As a measure-theoretic value, we define the typical recurrence triangle frequency dimension, which generally fluctuates around 1 when the underlying dynamics are governed by deterministic chaos. By contrast, the dimension becomes higher than 1 for a purely stochastic system. Additionally, the typical recurrence triangle frequency dimension correlates most precisely with DET among the above quantities. Our results show that (i) the common practice of using DET could be partly theoretically supported using recurrence triangles, and (ii) the variety of recurrence triangles behaves more consistently for identifying the strength of stochasticity for the underlying dynamics. The results in this study should be useful in checking basic properties for modeling a given time series. © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Sleep disorders pose serious cardiovascular threats if not treated effectively. However, adherence to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), the most recommended therapy, is known to be challenging to monitor. Telemonitored CPAP equipment has improved the follow-up of CPAP adherence (hours of use per night) by producing far larger amounts of data collected daily. The analysis of such data have relied on averaging the entire therapeutic history and interpreting it without a proper reference concerning the level of adherence. By contrast, we contribute with an unsupervised machine-learning methodology that (i) translates the adherence data to a scale of discrete numbers that hold correspondence to the most usual 30-day-long patterns as observed in a real-word database; (ii) avoids the loss of information aggregation problem by creating summaries of the time series that capture the dynamic nature of the everyday-use CPAP. Our experiments have detected eight particular adherence behaviors validated with information-oriented statistical criteria; we successfully applied them to the time series of a French hospital to produce summaries that reflect the adherence of any 30 days of interest. Our method can aid physicians in more precisely evaluating the therapy adherence, as well as fostering systems to alert of problems in the treatment automatically. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As the availability of big data-sets becomes more widespread so the importance of motif (or repeated pattern) identification and analysis increases. To date, the majority of motif identification algorithms that permit flexibility of sub-sequence length do so over a given range, with the restriction that both sides of an identified sub-sequence pair are of equal length. In this article, motivated by a better localised representation of variations in time series, a novel approach to the identification of motifs is discussed, which allows for some flexibility in side-length. The advantages of this flexibility include improved recognition of localised similar behaviour (manifested as motif shape) over varying timescales. As well as facilitating improved interpretation of localised volatility patterns and a visual comparison of relative volatility levels of series at a globalised level. The process described extends and modifies established techniques, namely SAX, MDL and the Matrix Profile, allowing advantageous properties of leading algorithms for data analysis and dimensionality reduction to be incorporated and future-proofed. Although this technique is potentially applicable to any time series analysis, the focus here is financial and energy sector applications where real-world examples examining S&P500 and Open Power System Data are also provided for illustration. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease courses are characterized by immuno-inflammatory, thrombotic, and parenchymal alterations. Prediction of individual COVID-19 disease courses to guide targeted prevention remains challenging. We hypothesized that a distinct serologic signature precedes surges of IL-6/D-dimers in severely affected COVID-19 patients. Methods: We performed longitudinal plasma profiling, including proteome, metabolome, and routine biochemistry, on seven seropositive, well-phenotyped patients with severe COVID-19 referred to the Intensive Care Unit at the German Heart Center. Patient characteristics were: 65 ± 8 years, 29% female, median CRP 285 ± 127 mg/dL, IL-6 367 ± 231 ng/L, D-dimers 7 ± 10 mg/L, and NT-proBNP 2616 ± 3465 ng/L. Results: Based on time-series analyses of patient sera, a prediction model employing feature selection and dimensionality reduction through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) revealed a number of candidate proteins preceding hyperinflammatory immune response (denoted ΔIL-6) and COVID-19 coagulopathy (denoted ΔD-dimers) by 24–48 h. These candidates are involved in biological pathways such as oxidative stress/inflammation (e.g., IL-1alpha, IL-13, MMP9, C-C motif chemokine 23), coagulation/thrombosis/immunoadhesion (e.g., P- and E-selectin), tissue repair (e.g., hepatocyte growth factor), and growth factor response/regulatory pathways (e.g., tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)). The latter are host- or co-receptors that promote SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells in the absence of ACE2. Conclusions: Our novel prediction model identified biological and regulatory candidate networks preceding hyperinflammation and coagulopathy, with the most promising group being the proteins that explain changes in D-dimers. These biomarkers need validation. If causal, our work may help predict disease courses and guide personalized treatment for COVID-19. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Summarization of a long time series often occurs in analytical applications related to decision-making, modeling, planning, and so on. Informally, summarization aims at discovering a small-sized set of typical patterns (subsequences) to briefly represent the long time series. Apparent approaches to summarization like motifs, shapelets, cluster centroids, and so on, either require training data or do not provide an analyst with information regarding the fraction of the time series that a typical subsequence found corresponds to. Recently introduced, the time series snippet concept overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. A snippet is a subsequence that is similar to many other subsequences of the time series with respect to a specially defined similarity measure based on the Euclidean distance. However, the original Snippet-Finder algorithm has cubic time complexity concerning the lengths of the time series and the snippet. In this article, we propose the PSF (Parallel Snippet-Finder) algorithm that accelerates the original snippet discovery schema with GPU and ensures acceptable performance over very long time series. As opposed to the original algorithm, PSF splits the calculation of the similarity of all the time series subsequences to a snippet into several steps, each of which is performed in parallel. Experimental evaluation over real-world time series shows that PSF outruns both the original algorithm and a straightforward parallelization. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Time series (TS) are sequences of values ordered in time. Such TS have in common, that important insights from the data can be drawn by inspecting local substructures, and not the recordings as a whole. ECG recordings, for instance, are characterized by normal or anomalous heartbeats that repeat themselves often within a longer TS. As such, many state-of-the-art time series data mining (TSDM) methods characterize TS by inspecting local substructures. The window size for extracting such subsequences is a crucial hyper-parameter, and setting an inappropriate value results in poor TSDM results. Finding the optimal window size has remained to be one of the most challenging tasks in TSDM domains, where no domain-agnostic method is known for learning the window size. We provide, for the first time, a systematic survey and experimental study of 6 TS window size selection (WSS) algorithms on three diverse TSDM tasks, namely anomaly detection, segmentation and motif discovery, using state-of-the art TSDM algorithms and benchmarks. We found that WSS methods are competitive with or even surpass human annotations, if an interesting or anomalous pattern can be attributed to (changes in) the period. That is because current WSS methods aim at finding the period length of data sets. This assumption is mostly true for segmentation or anomaly detection, by definition. In the case of motif discovery, however, the results were mixed. Motifs can be independent of a period, but repeat themselves unusually often. In this domain, WSS fails and more research is needed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

With the aim of identifying potential functional and regulatory motifs upstream of co-expressed genes, time-series derived gene expression profiles were clustered based on their time-course similarity, and their upstream regulatory gene sequences were analyzed here. Several conserved motifs were found upstream of co-expressed genes, which might be involved in binding specific transcription factors.

A motif represents two or more highly similar subsequences of a time series. The vast majority of the motif discovery methods implicitly assume that subsequences need to be normalized before determining their similarity. While normalization is widely adopted, it may affect the discovery of motifs. We examine the effect of normalization on motif discovery using 96 real-world time series. To determine if the discovered motifs are meaningful, all time series are assigned labels that indicate the states of the system generating the time series. Our experiments show that in over half of the considered cases, normalization affects motif discovery negatively by returning motifs that are not meaningful. We therefore conclude that the assumption underlying normalization does not always hold for real-world time series and thus should not be uncritically adopted. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Manufacturers are increasingly applying machine and deep learning to automate production quality monitoring to save time and costs. The most widely used approach is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to detect quality issues in production output images. While the approach achieves high accuracy, many companies face challenges implementing it. Many manufacturers lack both the big data sets required for machine and deep learning model training and the data scientists having the domain knowledge to build and run complex models. Today manufacturers have implemented lean manufacturing and six sigma quality controls which result in small defect samples that are not sufficient for modeling. Some manufacturers also change the production outputs frequently which does not permit enough time for data collection for model building. In this paper, we propose two motif discovery based approaches that work within the constraints of modern manufacturing. The first approach is programmatic motif discovery learning patterns from small data samples. The second approach is a self-service visual motif discovery that is simple and intuitive for engineers not versed in data science. We compare the proposed approaches with a CNN and conclude that our proposed methods achieve higher accuracy, have significantly lower computational costs, and empower engineers to do it themselves. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

It is essential to fully mine the hidden value of the massive measurement data on the demand side. To quickly and accurately identify the load evolution situation, a novel idea for a data-driven, simple and efficient analysis of the load fluctuation characteristics of the low-voltage distribution network is proposed based on the concept of the motif. For the individual loads, the relative relation of load power in a continuous time period is used as the criterion for the individual motif construction, and the detailed characteristics of load variations are extracted to identify the attribute of load; for the load clusters, the relative distance of overall load power fluctuations in a continuous-time period is adopted to construct clustered motifs, which can describe the aggregated fluctuation characteristics of the dispersed load, and infer the fluctuation rules of load clusters under the influence of external factors. Numerical experiments based on the multiple actual datasets show that the proposed method can achieve the accurate cognition of load fluctuation characteristics of low-voltage distribution networks at the individual and cluster levels, respectively. © 2022 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.},

Here, we offer a new approach based on the self-similarity of melodic lines recurring at various temporal scales. In contrast to the statistical analyses advanced in recent literature, the proposed method does not depend on averaging within time-windows and is distinctively local. The corresponding definition of the fractal dimension is based on the temporal scaling hierarchy and depends on the tonal contours of musical motifs. The new concepts are tested on musical “renditions” of the Cantor Set and the Koch Curve, and then applied to a number of carefully selected masterful compositions spanning five centuries of music making. © 2023 The Authors},

While offline exploration of time series can be useful, time series is almost unique in allowing the possibility of direct and immediate intervention. For example, if we are monitoring an industrial process and have an algorithm that predicts imminent failure, we could direct a controller to open a pressure release valve or initiate an evacuation plan. There is a plethora of tools to monitor time series for known behaviors (pattern matching), previously unknown highly conserved behaviors (motifs), evolving behaviors (chains) and unexpected behaviors (anomalies). In this work, we claim that there is another useful primitive, emerging behaviors that are worth monitoring for. We call such behaviors Novelets. We explain that Novelets are not anomalies, chains, or motifs but can be informally thought of as initially apparent anomalies that are later discovered to be motifs. We will show that Novelets have a natural interpretation in many disciplines, including science, medicine, and industry. As we will further demonstrate, Novelet discovery can have many downstream uses, including prognostics and abnormal behavior detection. We will demonstrate the utility of our proposed primitive on a diverse set of challenging domains. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

Time series analysis is used to analyze information in a wide variety of domains [128]: epidemiology, genomics, neuroscience, medicine, environmental sciences, economics, and more. Time series analysis includes finding similarities (mo-tifs) and anomalies (discords) between every two subsequences (i.e., slices of consecutive data points) of the time series. There are two major approaches for motif and discord discovery: approximate and exact algorithms. Approximate algorithms are faster than exact algorithms, but they can provide inaccurate results or limited discord detection, which cannot be tolerated by many applications (e.g., vehicle safety systems). Unlike approximate algorithms, exact algorithms do not yield false positives or discordant dismissals, but can be very time-consuming on large time series data. Thus, anytime versions (aka interruptible algorithms) of exact algorithms are proposed to provide approximate solutions quickly and can return a valid result even if the user stops their execution early. The state-of-the-art exact anytime method for motif and discord discovery is matrix profile [142], which is based on Euclidean distances and floating-point arithmetic. We evaluate a recent CPU implementation of the matrix profile algorithm [149] on a real multi-core machine (Intel Xeon Phi KNL [76]) and observe that its performance is heavily bottlenecked by data movement. In other words, the amount of computation per data access is not enough to hide the memory latency and thus time series analysis is memory-bound. This overhead caused by data movement limits the potential benefits of acceleration efforts that do not alleviate the data movement bottleneck in current time series applications. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Time series data are ubiquitous; large volumes of such data are routinely created in scientific, industrial, entertainment, medical and biological domains. Examples include ECG data, gait analysis, stock market quotes, machine health telemetry, search engine throughput volumes etc. VLDB has traditionally been home to much of the community’s best research on time series, with three to eight papers on time series appearing in the conference each year. What do we want to do with such time series? Everything! Classification, clustering, joins, anomaly detection, motif discovery, similarity search, visualization, summarization, compression, segmentation, rule discovery etc. Rather than a deep dive in just one of these subtopics, in this tutorial I will show a surprisingly small set of high-level representations, definitions, distance measures and primitives can be combined to solve the first 90 to 99.9% of the problems listed above. The tutorial will be illustrated with numerous real-world examples created just for this tutorial, including examples from robotics, wearables, medical telemetry, astronomy, and (especially) animal behavior. Moreover, all sample datasets and code snippets will be released so that the tutorial attendees (and later, readers) can first reproduce the results demonstrated, before attempting similar analysis on their data. © 2023, VLDB Endowment.

	abstract = {We introduce simplicial persistence, a measure of time evolution of motifs in networks obtained from correlation filtering. We observe long memory in the evolution of structures, with a two power law decay regimes in the number of persistent simplicial complexes. Null models of the underlying time series are tested to investigate properties of the generative process and its evolutional constraints. Networks are generated with both a topological embedding network filtering technique called TMFG and by thresholding, showing that the TMFG method identifies high order structures throughout the market sample, where thresholding methods fail. The decay exponents of these long memory processes are used to characterise financial markets based on their efficiency and liquidity. We find that more liquid markets tend to have a slower persistence decay. This appears to be in contrast with the common understanding that efficient markets are more random. We argue that they are indeed less predictable for what concerns the dynamics of each single variable but they are more predictable for what concerns the collective evolution of the variables. This could imply higher fragility to systemic shocks. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Understanding extensive transcriptional reprogramming events mediated by wounding during the oolong tea manufacturing process is essential for improving oolong tea quality. To improve our comprehension of the architecture of the wounding-induced gene regulatory network, we systematically analyzed the high-resolution transcriptomic and metabolomic data from wounding-treated (after turnover stage) tea leaves at 11 time points over a 220-min period. The results indicated that wounding activates a burst of transcriptional activity within 10 min and that the temporal expression patterns over time could be partitioned into 18 specific clusters with distinct biological processes. The transcription factor (TF) activity linked to the TF binding motif participated in specific biological processes within different clusters. A chronological model of the wounding-induced gene regulatory network provides insight into the dynamic transcriptional regulation event after wounding treatment (the turnover stage). Time series data of wounding-induced volatiles reveal the scientific significance of resting for a while after wounding treatment during the actual manufacturing process of oolong tea. Integrating information-rich expression data with information on volatiles allowed us to identify many high-confidence TFs participating in aroma formation regulation after wounding treatment by using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Collectively, our research revealed the complexity of the wounding-induced gene regulatory network and described wounding-mediated dynamic transcriptional reprogramming events, serving as a valuable theoretical basis for the quality formation of oolong tea during the post-harvest manufacturing process.

	abstract = {The use of static graphs for modelling and analysis of biological and biomedical data plays a key role in biomedical research. However, many real-world scenarios present dynamic behaviours resulting in both node and edges modification as well as feature evolution. Consequently, ad-hoc models for capturing these evolutions along the time have been introduced, also referred to as dynamic, temporal, time-varying graphs. Here, we focus on temporal graphs, i.e., graphs whose evolution is represented by a sequence of time-ordered snapshots. Each snapshot represents a graph active in a particular timestamp. We survey temporal graph models and related algorithms, presenting fundamentals aspects and the recent advances. We formally define temporal graphs, focusing on the problem setting and we present their main applications in biology and medicine. We also present temporal graph embedding and the application to recent problems such as epidemic modelling. Finally, we further state some promising research directions in the area. Main results of this study include a systematic review of fundamental temporal network problems and their algorithmic solutions considered in the literature, in particular those having application in computational biology and medicine.

	abstract = {Rapid technology integration causes a high dimensional time series data accumulation in multiple domains and applying the classical data mining tools and techniques becomes a challenging task. Hence, the time series data representation have gained popularity over the years, which ease the task of mining, analysis and visualization. Graph based representation is one such emerging tool in which the time series data is represented as nodes and edges of graph. The current graph based representation is designed either to mine the motif or discords from a single time series or cluster the time series where each node represents a time series sample. Such representation technique causes information loss and also no further analysis could be performed other than clustering. To address these challenges, we propose a unique graph representation for time series dataset that works on multiple domains. Novelty of the graph representation is that it is unique for multiple time series and it acts as a framework for whole time series clustering, temporal pattern extraction from each cluster and temporally dependent rare event discovery. A new research direction for the proposed graph based framework is shown. Comparative analysis reveal the superiority of the proposed framework particularly as a clustering technique. The key contributions of the paper are: (i) transformation strategy of time series database from time domain to graph structure in topological domain (ii) time series clustering using path level analysis (iii) identification of temporally dependent co-occurring patterns (iv) rare event detection using component level analysis © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The NAC (NAM-ATAF1/2-CUC) transcription factor family is one of the largest plant-specific transcription factor families, playing an important role in plant growth and development and abiotic stress response. As a short-rotation woody plant, Salix integra (S. integra) has high lead (Pb) phytoremediation potential. To understand the role of NAC in S. integra Pb tolerance, 53 SiNAC transcripts were identified using third-generation and next-generation transcriptomic data from S. integra exposed to Pb stress, and a phylogenetic analysis revealed 11 subfamilies. A sequence alignment showed that multiple subfamilies represented by TIP and ATAF had a gene that produced more than one transcript under Pb stress, and different transcripts had different responses to Pb. By analyzing the expression profiles of SiNACs at 9 Pb stress time points, 41 of 53 SiNACs were found to be significantly responsive to Pb. Short time-series expression miner (STEM) analysis revealed that 41 SiNACs had two significant Pb positive response patterns (early and late), both containing 10 SiNACs. The SiNACs with the most significant Pb response were mainly from the ATAF and NAP subfamilies. Therefore, 4 and 3 SiNACs from the ATAF and NAP subfamilies, respectively, were selected as candidate Pb-responsive SiNACs for further structural and functional analysis. The RT-qPCR results of 7 transcripts also confirmed the different Pb response patterns of the ATAF and NAP subfamilies. SiNAC004 and SiNAC120, which were randomly selected from two subfamilies, were confirmed to be nuclear localization proteins by subcellular localization experiments. Functional prediction analysis of the associated transcripts of seven candidate SiNACs showed that the target pathways of ATAF subfamily SiNACs were “sulfur metabolism” and “glutathione metabolism”, and the target pathways of NAP subfamily SiNACs were “ribosome” and “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”. This study not only identified two NAC subfamilies with different Pb response patterns but also identified Pb-responsive SiNACs that could provide a basis for subsequent gene function verification. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Variable-length anomalous subsequence detection in time series has many important applications in the real world, yet the methods presented in existing studies are computationally expensive, as the detection techniques are mostly brute-force approaches. In this work, we formalize the detection problem into a subsequence segmentation problem (SSP) optimization task, in which the time series is segmented by a set of cutting points into subsequences with minimized total distances to the representative motif. The anomalous subsequences can then be accurately located by reducing the dissimilarity among all subsequences, and this technique, when compared to existing techniques, can reduce the number of comparisons required for search. We further introduce a new clustering-based and swarm intelligence-based evolutionary algorithm (CBSI) in this work to solve the highly complex SSP efficiently. The proposed method balances the scopes of exploration and exploitation under a local-global search strategy. The CBSI clusters the solutions in the search space into groups, allowing frequent information sharing among solutions in the same cluster for their exploitation within their own search spaces. Furthermore, the best local solutions are promoted by the global-search strategy to explore the remaining search regions. Through a comparison with existing state-of-the-art techniques in solving both synthetic and real-world problems, we show that any optimization methods under our proposed SSP bring significant computational savings and comparable searching accuracy compared to existing techniques for the detection task. Our proposed CBSI also has the highest searching capability compared to existing and related optimization methods. The experimental results also highlight the scalability of our study to longer time series, larger anomaly sizes and wider search ranges. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The research on social media-based academic communication has made great progress with the development of the mobile Internet era, and while a large number of research results have emerged, clarifying the topology of the knowledge label network (KLN) in this field and showing the development of its knowledge labels and related concepts is one of the issues that must be faced. This study aims to discuss the aforementioned issue. Design/methodology/approach: From a bibliometric perspective, 5,217 research papers in this field from CNKI from 2011 to 2021 are selected, and the title and abstract of each paper are subjected to subword processing and topic model analysis, and the extended labels are obtained by taking the merged set with the original keywords, so as to construct a conceptually expanded KLN. At the same time, appropriate time window slicing is performed to observe the temporal evolution of the network topology. Specifically, the basic network topological parameters and the complex modal structure are analyzed empirically to explore the evolution pattern and inner mechanism of the KLN in this domain. In addition, the ARIMA time series prediction model is used to further predict and compare the changing trend of network structure among different disciplines, so as to compare the differences among different disciplines. Findings: The results show that the degree sequence distribution of the KLN is power-law distributed during the growth process, and it performs better in the mature stage of network development, and the network shows more stable scale-free characteristics. At the same time, the network has the characteristics of “short path and high clustering” throughout the time series, which is a typical small-world network. The KLN consists of a small number of hub nodes occupying the core position of the network, while a large number of label nodes are distributed at the periphery of the network and formed around these hub nodes, and its knowledge expansion pattern has a certain retrospective nature. More knowledge label nodes expand from the center to the periphery and have a gradual and stable trend. In addition, there are certain differences between different disciplines, and the research direction or topic of library and information science (LIS) is more refined and deeper than that of journalism and media and computer science. The LIS discipline has shown better development momentum in this field. Originality/value: KLN is constructed by using extended labels and empirically analyzed by using network frontier conceptual motifs, which reflects the innovation of the study to a certain extent. In future research, the influence of larger-scale network motifs on the structural features and evolutionary mechanisms of KLNs will be further explored. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Complex transcriptional networks regulate plant defense against pathogen attack, and plant transcription factors act as key regulators of the plant immune responses. The differences between transcription factor expression and regulation in Chinese cabbage soft rot (Pectobacterium carotovorum; Pc) have not been revealed. In this study, a total of 148 putative Chinese cabbage WRKY genes (BrWRKYs) were identified from the Chinese cabbage genome (v3.0). These genes were divided into seven subgroups (groups I, IIa–e, and III) based on phylogenomic analysis, with distinct motif compositions in each subgroup. Time-series RNA-seq was carried out to elucidate the dynamic expression patterns of the BrWRKYs on the resistant mutant (sr) and the susceptible wild-type (inbred WT) challenged by Pc. Transcriptional analysis showed that 48 WRKY transcription genes at 0–24 hpi were significantly upregulated in sr under soft rot stress. At the 12-h post-inoculation critical time point, we identified three specifically upregulated genes and two downregulated genes in the resistant mutant, which may provide potential applications for genetic improvement against soft rot. The findings improved our understanding of the WRKY-mediated soft rot stress response regulation in Chinese cabbage. The study thus lays a foundation for the genetic improvement of soft rot resistance. Copyright © 2022 Yan, Yu, Ma, Sun, Ge, Yue, Han, Zhao, Lu and Liu.},

	abstract = {DNA can determine where and when genes are expressed, but the full set of sequence determinants that control gene expression is unknown. Here, we measured the transcriptional activity of DNA sequences that represent an ~100 times larger sequence space than the human genome using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Machine learning models revealed that transcription factors (TFs) generally act in an additive manner with weak grammar and that most enhancers increase expression from a promoter by a mechanism that does not appear to involve specific TF–TF interactions. The enhancers themselves can be classified into three types: classical, closed chromatin and chromatin dependent. We also show that few TFs are strongly active in a cell, with most activities being similar between cell types. Individual TFs can have multiple gene regulatory activities, including chromatin opening and enhancing, promoting and determining transcription start site (TSS) activity, consistent with the view that the TF binding motif is the key atomic unit of gene expression. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Motivation: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies provide an opportunity to infer cell-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which is an important challenge in systems biology. Although numerous methods have been developed for inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data, it is still a challenge to deal with cellular heterogeneity. Results: To address this challenge, we developed an interpretable transformer-based method namely STGRNS for inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data. In this algorithm, gene expression motif technique was proposed to convert gene pairs into contiguous sub-vectors, which can be used as input for the transformer encoder. By avoiding missing phase-specific regulations in a network, gene expression motif can improve the accuracy of GRN inference for different types of scRNA-seq data. To assess the performance of STGRNS, we implemented the comparative experiments with some popular methods on extensive benchmark datasets including 21 static and 27 time-series scRNA-seq dataset. All the results show that STGRNS is superior to other comparative methods. In addition, STGRNS was also proved to be more interpretable than “black box” deep learning methods, which are well-known for the difficulty to explain the predictions clearly. © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of signal motif discovery. In the formulation considered, the goal is to find an unknown pattern (or motif) repeated across multiple data sets. This problem formulation can be applied to various domains, such as DNA sequence alignment and matching, motif discovery in time-series, and object detection and localization in images. We take the approach of minimizing an objective that is the sum over a measure of the difference between a candidate instance in each signal collection (or set) and the unknown pattern. Additionally, a non-negative instance dependent penalty is introduced. The proposed general objective can be used to capture well-known problems (e.g., blind joint time-delay estimation). Due to the non-convex nature of the problem and often the integer programming flavor of the approach, brute-force solution is non-polynomial and computationally prohibitive for large scale problems. We propose an efficient polynomial time (quadratic in the number of instances) bipartite graph based approximation to solve the problem. We provide a theoretical analysis for the proposed solution including bounds on the gap from the optimal solution and conditions for optimality. In particular, we show that the objective value for the proposed solution is no more than twice the objective value of the optimal solution. To illustrate the merit of the proposed approach, we present qualitative and quantitative empirical analysis of the proposed approach on several applications and compare our method to appropriate alternatives. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

The resilience of the algorithm used to generate the MP when faced with noisy data remains unknown. We measure the similarities between the MP from original time series data with MPs generated from the same data with noisy data added under a range of parameter settings including adding duplicates and adding irrelevant data. We use three real world data sets drawn from diverse domains for these experiments Based on dissimilarities between the MPs, our results suggest that MP generation is resilient to a small amount of noise being introduced into the data but as the amount of noise increases this reslience disappears.  © 2023 Hehir, Smeaton.},

	abstract = {‘Huangguan’ pear (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd) fruit is susceptible to cold, characterized by developing peel browning spots (PBS) during cold storage. Additionally, ethylene pretreatment reduces chilling injury (CI) and inhibits PBS occurrence, but the mechanism of CI remains unclear. Here, we deciphered the dynamic transcriptional changes during the PBS occurrence with and without ethylene pretreatment via time-series transcriptome. We found that ethylene suppressed the cold-signaling gene expression, thereby decreasing the cold sensitivity of the ‘Huangguan’ fruit. Moreover, the “Yellow” module closely correlated with PBS occurrence was identified via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and this module was related to plant defense via Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Local motif enrichment analysis suggested that the “Yellow” module genes were regulated by ERF and WRKY transcription factors. Functional studies demonstrated that PbWRKY31 has a conserved WRKY domain, lacks transactivation activity, and localizes in the nucleus. PbWRKY31-overexpressed Arabidopsis were hypersensitive to cold, with higher expression levels of cold signaling and defense genes, suggesting that PbWRKY31 participates in regulating plant cold sensitivity. Collectively, our findings provide a comprehensive transcriptional overview of PBS occurrence and elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ethylene reduces the cold sensitivity of ‘Huangguan’ fruit as well as the potential role of PbWRKY31 in this process. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This review outlined recent developments in deep learning time series forecasting technology for the needs of industrial applications. With the advances in industrial automation, the storage and analysis of massive production data have become possible. Traditional mechanism modeling methods based on statistics encounter difficulties in dealing with high-dimensional industrial problems. Thus, time series forecasting for complex processes and products has played an important role in industrial scenarios, such as device modeling, production forecasting, remaining life prediction, and precise control, thereby receiving considerable attention from both academia and industry. To methodically review the time series forecasting method and its industrial applications, this review first introduced the three types of time series forecasting, namely, statistical learning, integrated learning, and deep learning, and compared their ease of use, complexity, and applicability issues. Focusing on industrial data analysis and decision-making, this review analyzed the three types of deep learning models, namely, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network, and encoder-decoder network. The advantages and disadvantages of these three types of models and the applicable industrial environment were given, and how they can be embedded in industrial application sites to reduce costs and improve production efficiency was described. Afterward, to evaluate the performance of different algorithms clearly and comprehensively, statistical metrics and loss functions for the point prediction sequence and shape (motif) prediction problems were presented. At the same time, this review compiled classic public datasets of the industry for researchers to quickly find authoritative assessment data for an industry sector or issue. Taking mining and metallurgy in the process industry as examples, this review presented some widespread problems in this field, such as nonlinearity, long time delays, and unobservability of variables. This review also showed how deep-learning-based time series forecasting techniques can solve the aforementioned problems, build soft sensors, create digital twins, and achieve the visualization of complex processes. This review revealed that the application of deep learning in the process industry requires highly robust and strongly interpretable or explainable algorithms. For the robustness problem, the use of the ordinary differential equation model and Kalman filter method to solve the modeling of irregularly sampled time series and the use of the deep learning method to detect online sensor abnormalities were proposed. For the interpretability problem, sample-based, structure-based interpretable, and external co-explanation methods were introduced. This review also analyzed how explainable techniques can be applied to industrial deep learning models. Finally, the future directions of time series research were discussed in terms of both deep learning methods and industrial applications. Copyright ©2022 Chinese Journal of Engineering.

	abstract = {Most methods for explaining black-box classifiers (e.g., on tabular data, images, or time series) rely on measuring the impact that removing/perturbing features has on the model output. This forces the explanation language to match the classifier's feature space. However, when dealing with graph data, in which the basic features correspond to the edges describing the graph structure, this matching between features space and explanation language might not be appropriate. Decoupling the feature space (edges) from a desired high-lever explanation language (such as motifs) is thus a major challenge towards developing actionable explanations for graph classification tasks. In this paper we introduce Graphshap, a Shapley-based approach able to provide motif-based explanations for identityaware graph classifiers, assuming no knowledge whatsoever about the model or its training data: the only requirement is that the classifier can be queried as a black-box at will. For the sake of computational efficiency we explore a progressive approximation strategy and show how a simple kernel can efficiently approximate explanation scores, thus allowing Graphshap to scale on scenarios with a large explanation space (i.e., large number of motifs). We showcase Graphshap on a real-world brain-network dataset consisting of patients affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder and a control group. Our experiments highlight how the classification provided by a black-box model can be effectively explained by few connectomics patterns. © 2023 IEEE.},

We focus on the lane change prediction of vehicles on a highway. In order to understand wrong decisions, which may lead to accidents, we want to interpret the reasons for a ML algorithm's decision making. To this end, we use motif discovery - a data mining method - to obtain sub-sequences representing typical driving behavior. With the help of these meaningful sub-sequences (motifs), we can study typical driving maneuvers on a highway. On top of this, we propose to replace non-interpretable ML algorithms with an interpretable alternative: a Mixture of Experts (MoE) classifier. We present an MoE classifier consisting of different k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifiers trained only on motifs, which represent a few samples from the dataset. These k-NN-based experts are fully interpretable, making the lane change prediction fully interpretable, too. Using our proposed MoE classifier, we are able to solve the lane change prediction problem in an interpretable manner. These MoE classifiers show a classification performance comparable to common non-interpretable ML methods from the literature.  © 2016 IEEE.},

This question is important for SNN implementation of the model-based reinforcement learning (RL), finding anomalies in time series and other problems. In the present work, we formalize world dynamics as a Markov chain with a priori unknown state transition probabilities, which should be learnt by the network. To make this problem formulation more realistic, we solve it in the continuous time, so that the duration of every state in the Markov chain may be different and is unknown. It is demonstrated how this task can be accomplished by an SNN with a specially designed structure and local synaptic plasticity rules. As an example, we show how this network motif works in the simple but non-trivial world where a ball moves inside a square box and bounces from its walls with a random new direction and velocity. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The successes of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are largely attributed to mimicking the human brain structures. Recent advances in neuroscience revealed that neurons interact with each other through various kinds of connectivity patterns to process information, in which the common connectivity patterns are also called circuit motifs. However, many existing ANNs can only model one or two circuit motifs in their architectures, so that their performance may drastically vary among different types of machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new type of neural network inspired by the architectures of neuronal circuits, namely Circuit Neural Network (CircuitNet). In CircuitNet, a group of densely connected neurons, namely circuit motif unit (CMU), form the basic unit of the network, which is capable of modeling universal circuit motifs by adjusting the weights within the CMUs. Compared with traditional feed-forward networks, CircuitNet has the ability to model more types of neuron connections such as feed-back and lateral motifs. Inspired by the locally dense and globally sparse structure of the human brain, several iterations of signal transmission among different CMUs are achieved by sparse connections through the input ports and output ports of different CMUs. Experiments have demonstrated that CircuitNet can outperform popular neural network architectures in function approximation, reinforcement learning, image classification, and time series forecasting tasks. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

For example, we can observe similar waveforms corresponding to kitchen knife chopping actions using body-worn accelerometers in kitchens and can also observe similar sound features by active sound probing in bathrooms because of their water-resistant walls. This indicates that such location-specific sensor data motifs can be inherent information for location class prediction in almost every environment. This study proposes a novel method that automatically detects location-specific motifs from time series sensor data by calculating a score that represents the 'location specificity' of each motif in a time series. Previous studies on location class prediction assume that location-specific sensor data are always observed in a room or use handcrafted rules and templates to detect location-specific sensor data resulting in difficulties in applying them to several realistic environments. In contrast, our method, named IndoLabel, can automatically discover short sensor data motifs, specific to a location class, and can automatically build an environment-independent location classifier without requiring handcrafted rules and templates. The proposed method was evaluated in real house environments using leave-one-environment-out cross-validation and achieved a state-of-The-Art performance although labeled training data in the target environment was unavailable. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

Using a hybrid ESS, both high-frequency and low-frequency power variations can be addressed at the same time. For an accurate sizing of a hybrid ESS, the use of high-resolution data is required. However, high-resolution data over long periods leads to large data sets, which are difficult to handle. In this paper, an improved motif discovery algorithm is introduced to find the most recurring daily consumption patterns within the time series of interest. The most recurring pattern is selected as the representative of the time series for sizing the hybrid ESS. Next, a simple optimization framework is proposed for selecting the cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter, used for allocating the power to different storage technologies. Finally, the proposed sizing approach is applied for sizing a hybrid battery-flywheel ESS at four different low voltage distribution grids in southern Germany using real measurement data. It is demonstrated that a hybrid ESS, with the characteristics derived from the most recurring patterns only, can effectively provide their intended grid services for most of the days during the whole period of the time series.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Recently, time series chains (TSCs) were introduced as an expansion of time series motifs to identify the continuous evolving patterns in time series data. TSCs are shown to be able to reveal latent continuous evolving trends in the time series, and identify precursors of unusual events in complex systems. However, existing TSC definitions lack the ability to accurately cover the evolving part of a time series: the discovered chains can be easily cut by noise and can include non-evolving patterns, making them impractical in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a new TSC definition based on an incremental nearest neighbor concept which can better locate the evolving patterns while excluding the non-evolving ones, and propose two new quality metrics to rank the discovered chains. With extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed TSC definition is significantly more robust to noise than the state of the art, and the top ranked chains discovered can reveal meaningful regularities in a variety of real world datasets.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Existing motif discovery algorithms that support Dynamic Time Warping require manual determination of the exact length of motifs. However, setting appropriate length for interesting motifs can be challenging and selecting inappropriate motif lengths may result in valuable patterns being overlooked. This paper addresses the above problem by proposing algorithms that automatically compute motifs of all lengths using Dynamic Time Warping. Specifically, a batch algorithm as well as an anytime algorithm are designed in this paper, which are refered as BatchMotif and AnytimeMotif respectively. The proposed algorithms achieve significant improvements in efficiency by fully leveraging the correlations between the motifs of different lengths. Experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of both of the proposed algorithms. On average, BatchMotif is 13 times faster than the baseline method. Additionally, AnytimeMotif is 7 times faster than the baseline method and is capable of providing relatively satisfying results with only a small portion of calculation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Unlike periodical series where motifs are contiguously aligned, in several applications, co-evolving series tend to exhibit motifs that are non-contiguously aligned. Capturing the mechanism of motif shifts in such evolving series poses significant challenges in predicting their respective subsequent appearances. This prompted us to devise a principled approach capable of handling series with non-contiguous motifs. In summary, we propose a sliding window analysis from which we devise a motif map that reflects the previous time-dependent mechanism of motif shifts occurring in a data set that comprises multiple time series. Based on the motif map, we model the motif transition mechanism via a dynamic Cox model and Support Vector Regression, which allows the prediction of series values at subsequent times. The originality of our approach lies in its modeling of time-dependent motif transition probabilities that have usually been assumed to be static in most of the existing work.

Thus, time series pattern recognition has been the core functionality in time series data mining applications. However, mining of unknown scalable time series patterns with variable lengths is by no means trivial. It could result in quadratic computational complexities to the search space, which is computationally untenable even with the state-of-the-art time series pattern mining algorithms. The mining of scalable unknown time series patterns also requires the superiority of the similarity measure, which is clearly beyond the comprehension of standard distance measure in time series. It has been a deadlock in the pursuit of a robust similarity measure, while trying to contain the complexity of the time series pattern search algorithm.

	abstract = {When multiple sensors record spatially proximate areas of activity, spreading activity patterns appear as temporally shifted signals in multiple time series. This is particularly prominent in the domains of medical and health analysis, where multi-sensory data is the object of time-elastic investigation. Tracing the spread of these patterns still remains a challenge in time series analysis. In this paper, we propose Motif Tracking for Spatially Ordered Time Series (MoTrack), an algorithm to efficiently track the propagation of individual patterns of activity throughout spatially ordered time series. Additionally, we present the concept of propagation trees to represent this propagation for a given point of origin. We investigate our proposal by applying MoTrack to high-frequency recordings of the electrical activity of β-cells located inside the pancreatic islet. The results confirm MoTrack's capability to trace dynamically evolving signals in such recordings and indicate that future work using this approach can address current challenges in diabetes research. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While offline exploration of time series can be useful, time series analysis is almost unique in allowing the possibility of direct and immediate intervention. For example, if we are monitoring an industrial process and our algorithm predicts imminent failure, the algorithm could direct a controller to open a release valve or alert a response team. There now exist mature tools to monitor time series for known behaviors (template matching), previously unknown highly conserved behaviors (motifs) and unexpected behaviors (anomalies). In this work we claim that there is another useful primitive, emerging behaviors, that are worth monitoring for. We call such behaviors Novelets. We explain that Novelets are neither anomalies nor motifs but can be loosely thought of as initially apparent anomalies that are later realized to be motifs. We will show Novelets have a natural interpretation in many disciplines, including science, medicine, and industry. As we will further demonstrate, Novelet discovery can have many downstream uses, including prognostics and abnormal behavior detection. We will demonstrate the utility of our proposed primitive on a diverse set of domains.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {G-quadruplex (G4) has been previously observed to be associated with gene expression. In this study, we performed integrative analysis on G4 multi-omics data from in-silicon prediction and ChIP-seq in human genome. Potential G4 sites were classified into three distinguished groups, such as one group of high-confidence G4-forming locations (G4-II) and groups only containing either ChIP-seq detected G4s (G4-I) or predicted G4 motif candidates (G4-III). We explored the associations of different-confidence G4 groups with other epigenetic regulatory elements, including CpG islands, chromatin status, enhancers, super-enhancers, G4 locations compared to the genes, and DNA methylation. Our elastic net regression model revealed that G4 structures could correlate with gene expression in two opposite ways depending on their locations to the genes as well as G4-forming DNA strand. Some transcription factors were identified to be over-represented with G4 emergence. The motif analysis discovered distinct consensus sequences enriched in the G4 feet, the flanking regions of two groups of G4s. We found high GC content in the feet of high-confidence G4s (G4-II) when compared to high TA content in solely predicted G4 feet of G4-III. Overall, we uncovered the comprehensive associations of G4 formations or predictions with other epigenetic and transcriptional elements which potentially coordinate gene transcription.

	abstract = {Accurate identification for the information flow between epileptic seizure signals is the key to construct the directional epileptic brain network which can be used to localize epileptic focus. In this paper, our concern is on how to improve the direction identification of information flow and also investigate how it can be cut off or weakened. In view of this, we propose the deep-layer motif method. Based on the directional index (DI) estimation using permutation conditional mutual information, the effectiveness of the proposed deep-layer motif method is numerically assessed with the coupled mass neural model. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of this method in considering the interference of autaptic coupling, time delay and short-term plasticity. Results show that compared to the simple 1-layer motif method, the 2nd- and 3rd-layer motif methods have the dominant enhancement effects for the direction identification. In particular, deep-layer motif method possesses good anti-jamming performance and good robustness in calculating DI. In addition, we investigate the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on the information flow. It is found that this deep-layer motif method is still superior to the single-layer motif method in direction identification and is robust to weak DBS. However, the high-frequency strong DBS can effectively decrease the DI suggesting the weakened information flow. These results may give new insights into the seizure detection and control. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of big data technology, how to mine useful association rules from a large amount of time series data is an important task in the field of water resources. Mining potential association rules between time series modalities has become a hot topic, which will provide effective help for water governance to predict future hydrological trends. The traditional method of mining hydrological data has two drawbacks: Firstly, the traditional method focuses more on the similarity of modalities in the process of modal mining, so it is easy to mine similar modalities and instances in large-scale data, thus generating redundancy; secondly, the traditional method ignores asynchronous rules in the mining of temporal association rules, and this will lose many valuable rules. In this paper, we propose a three-step pruning method for modal mining, which improves on the MASS algorithm. We propose a constraint-based association rule mining algorithm that achieves asynchronous rule mining by introducing a minimum overlap threshold and a maximum time interval. Finally, we conducted experiments on the hydrological dataset. Compared with other methods, the experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper is effective. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Air traffic system is a typical complex network with dynamic delay propagation between airports. However, difficulties in measuring delay propagation strength and constructing rational networks make investigating the features of delay propagation based on real data from the perspective of complex network is rarely seen. In this paper, using two largest real-world flights dataset of China and the USA over a period of two months in 2018 (from Jul. to Aug.), we construct the delay propagation networks among airports by calculating causality relationship between delay time series of airports. We identify the multilayer structures of networks by k-core decomposition and reveal that a core layer with a few of tightly connected airports dominants delay propagation in the whole systems. Through the analysis on motifs, bidirectional edges are found to be the culprit to expand the scope of delay propagation from airport pairs to local structures. At the system level, we analyze the properties of communities and found that airports geographically close to each other are likely to be classified into a delay propagation community, while the delay propagation between communities is mainly affected by the air traffic flow between them. Moreover, through the comparisons of structures for the delay propagation networks on different days, we reveal the temporal dependence of delay propagation that the more serious the delay propagation in one day, the more similar it will be to that in the next day. Finally, the usefulness of features found is assessed through applying them to predict the delay propagation in the future. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of big data has occurred in many fields of knowledge, one of which is astronomy. One example of a large dataset in astronomy is that of numerically integrated time series asteroid orbital elements from a time span of millions to billions of years. For example, the mean motion resonance (MMR) data of an asteroid are used to find out the duration that the asteroid was in a resonance state with a particular planet. For this reason, this research designs a computational model to obtain the mean motion resonance quickly and effectively by modifying and implementing the Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) algorithm and the motif discovery random projection algorithm on big data platforms (i.e., Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark). There are five following steps on the model: (i) saving data into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS); (ii) importing files to the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD); (iii) preprocessing the data; (iv) calculating the motif discovery by executing the User-Defined Function (UDF) program; and (v) gathering the results from the UDF to the HDFS and the .csv file. The results indicated a very significant reduction in computational time between the use of the standalone method and the use of the big data platform. The proposed computational model obtained an average accuracy of 83%, compared with the SwiftVis software. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging tasks in time-series prediction is a model’s capability to accurately learn the repeating granular trends in the data’s structure to generate effective predictions. Traditionally specially tuned statistical models and deep learning models like recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks are used to tackle such problem of sequence modeling. However in practice, factors like inadequate parameters in case of statistical models, random weight initializations, and data inadequacy in case of deep learning models affect the resulting final predictions. As a possible solution to these known problems, this paper introduces a novel method of time-series labeling (TSL) comprising a combination of encoding and decoding methodologies that not only takes into account the granular structure of a time-series data but also its underlying meta-learners for better predictive accuracy. To demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness and capability of handling wide range of scenarios, comparisons are drawn first over different widely used statistical and deep learning models and then applying TSL to each of them in order to showcase the resulting performance improvement when implemented over a wide variety of real-world datasets. The experimental findings reflect an average of 25% increase in overall performance when using TSL along with mostly similar performance of different combinations regardless of model complexity thereby proving its efficacy in predicting periodic data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

We improve on a straightforward application of LSH to time series data by developing a self-tuning algorithm that adapts to the data distribution. Furthermore, we include several optimizations to the algorithm, reducing redundant computations and leveraging the structure of time series data to speed up LSH computations.

	abstract = {Introduction: Nitrogen (N) is essential for plant growth and yield production and can be taken up from soil in the form of nitrate or peptides. The NITRATE TRANSPORTER 1/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER family (NPF) genes play important roles in the uptake and transportation of these two forms of N. Methods: Bioinformatic analysis was used to identify and characterize the NPF genes in Setaria. RNA-seq was employed to analyze time-series low nitrate stress response of the SiNPF genes. Yeast and Arabidopsis mutant complementation were used to test the nitrate transport ability of SiNRT1.1B1 and SiNRT1.1B2. Results: We identified 92 and 88 putative NPF genes from foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) and its wild ancestor green foxtail (Setaria viridis L.), respectively. These NPF genes were divided into eight groups according to their sequence characteristics and phylogenetic relationship, with similar intron-exon structure and motifs in the same subfamily. Twenty-six tandem duplication and 13 segmental duplication events promoted the expansion of SiNPF gene family. Interestingly, we found that the tandem duplication of the SiNRT1.1B gene might contribute to low nitrogen tolerance of foxtail millet. The gene expression atlas showed that the SiNPFs were divided into two major clusters, which were mainly expressed in root and the above ground tissues, respectively. Time series transcriptomic analysis further revealed the response of these SiNPF genes to short- and long- time low nitrate stress. To provide natural variation of gene information, we carried out a haplotype analysis of these SiNPFs and identified 2,924 SNPs and 400 InDels based on the re-sequence data of 398 foxtail millet accessions. We also predicted the three-dimensional structure of the 92 SiNPFs and found that the conserved proline 492 residues were not in the substrate binding pocket. The interactions of SiNPF proteins with (Formula presented.) were analyzed using molecular docking and the pockets were then identified. We found that the SiNPFs- (Formula presented.) binding energy ranged from -3.8 to -2.7 kcal/mol. Discussion: Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the NPF gene family in Setaria and will contribute to function dissection of these genes for crop breeding aimed at improving high nitrogen use efficiency.

	abstract = {Time series data remains a perennially important datatype considered in data mining. In the last decade there has been an increasing realization that time series data can be best understood by reasoning about time series subsequences on the basis of their similarity to other subsequences: the two most familiar such time series concepts being motifs and discords. Time series motifs refer to two particularly close subsequences, whereas time series discords indicate subsequences that are far from their nearest neighbors. However, we argue that it can sometimes be useful to simultaneously reason about a subsequence’s closeness to certain data and its distance to other data. In this work we introduce a novel primitive called the Contrast Profile that allows us to efficiently compute such a definition in a principled way. As we will show, the Contrast Profile has many downstream uses, including anomaly detection, data exploration, and preprocessing unstructured data for classification. We demonstrate the utility of the Contrast Profile by showing how it allows end-to-end classification in datasets with tens of billions of datapoints, and how it can be used to explore datasets and reveal subtle patterns that might otherwise escape our attention. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of the Contrast Profile by presenting detailed case studies in domains as diverse as seismology, animal behavior, and cardiology. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Cyber security threats on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to disrupt physical systems such as power grids and water treatment plants are a harsh fact of today’s world. Anomalous activities, such as cyber-attacks, must be detected and prevented as soon as possible. ICSs are used in a wide range of fields and industries, including water treatment plants, power distribution and generation, transportation, medical systems, defence, and many others, which make them an attractive target for security attacks for various reasons, including economic, criminal, military, espionage, political and terrorism as well. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to control industrial control systems. It collects data from sensors linked to a physical process and remotely controls the process using electronic control of actuators, switches, and valves to handle complex and potentially dangerous operations. System data from a real water treatment process with attacks is analyzed in this paper. This paper uses a collection of supervised learning algorithms to investigate attacks and intrusions in the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed. The study aims to detect abnormal activity in vulnerable sensors, actuators, HMIs, and SCADA systems and develop a methodology for countering intrusions. Matrix Profiles, a motif discovery algorithm for time series, is extended to perform the analysis. Binary and tertiary actuators may be introduced into the research in a meaningful manner by expanding Matrix Profiles with a Hamming distance metric. This algorithm has a low learning curve and produces reliable results. It also has the capability of being used in real-time. The applicability of the extended Matrix Profiles is demonstrated by analyzing selected actuators from the data collection. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {A time series motif intuitively is a short time series that repeats itself approximately the same within a larger time series. Such motifs often represent concealed structures, such as heart beats in an ECG recording, the riff in a pop song, or sleep spindles in EEG sleep data. Motif discovery (MD) is the task of finding such motifs in a given input series. As there are varying definitions of what exactly a motif is, a number of different algorithms exist. As central parameters they all take the length l of the motif and the maximal distance r between the motif ’s occurrences. In practice, however, especially suitable values for r are very hard to determine upfront, and found motifs show a high variability even for very similar r values. Accordingly, finding an interesting motif with these methods requires extensive trial-and-error. In this paper, we present a different approach to the MD problem. We define k-Motiflets as the set of exactly k occurrences of a motif of length l, whose maximum pairwise distance is minimal. This turns the MD problem upside-down: The central parameter of our approach is not the distance threshold r, but the desired number of occurrence k of the motif, which we show is considerably more intuitive and easier to set. Based on this definition, we present exact and approximate algorithms for finding k-Motiflets and analyze their complexity. To further ease the use of our method, we describe statistical tools to automatically determine meaningful values for its input parameters. Thus, for the first time, extracting meaningful motif sets without any a-priori knowledge becomes feasible. By evaluation on several real-world data sets and comparison to four state-of-the-art MD algorithms, we show that our proposed algorithm is both quantitatively superior to its competitors, finding larger motif sets at higher similarity, and qualitatively better, leading to clearer and easier to interpret motifs without any need for manual tuning. © 2022, VLDB Endowment.

We build time series of directed event networks for a set of spatial distances, and based on scan-statistics, the spatial distance that generates the strongest change of event network connections is chosen. In addition, we propose an empirical random network event generator to detect significant motifs throughout time. This generator preserves the spatial configuration but randomizes the order of the occurrence of events. To prevent the large number of links from masking the count of motifs, we propose using standardized counts of motifs at each time slot. Our methodology is able to detect interaction radius in space, build time series of networks, and describe changes in its topology over time, by means of identification of different types of motifs that allows for the understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the phenomena.

	abstract = {Exploring hidden structures in subsequences extracted from long-term time-series data is one of the primary tasks of time-series data analysis. Clustering is one of the most commonly used techniques in that context; however, various existing issues must be addressed, such as the way to extract less-overlapping subsequences and the definition of the inter-subsequence similarity. Especially in multi-dimensional data analysis, correlations among variables should also be emphasized. To boost users’ exploration of the universalities of subsequences, we incorporate multi-dimensional time-series subsequence clustering methods and visual clustering analysis interface into TimeTubesX, which is an integrated visual analytics environment for multi-dimensional time-dependent observation datasets of blazars. TimeTubesX extracts and filters subsequences with various lengths according to the characteristics of the data and clusters them automatically in consideration of correlations among observed attributes. And then, it allows users to visually examine the clustering results in terms of the cluster features, intercluster transitions, and temporal distributions of clusters. Through the application to two practical case studies, we demonstrate how the enhanced TimeTubesX enables users to see not only instances but also universalities (i.e., time-series motifs or cluster prototypes) in time-series observations of blazars. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The transdisciplinary nature of science as a whole became evident as the necessity for the complex nature of phenomena to explain social and life science, along with the physical sciences, blossomed into complexity theory and most recently into complexitysynchronization. This science motif is based on the scaling arising from the 1/f-variability in complex dynamic networks and the need for a network of networks to exchange information internally during intra-network dynamics and externally during inter-network dynamics. The measure of complexity adopted herein is the multifractal dimension of the crucial event time series generated by an organ network, and the difference in the multifractal dimensions of two organ networks quantifies the relative complexity between interacting complex networks. Information flows from dynamic networks at a higher level of complexity to those at lower levels of complexity, as summarized in the ‘complexity matching effect’, and the flow is maximally efficient when the complexities are equal. Herein, we use the scaling of empirical datasets from the brain, cardiovascular and respiratory networks to support the hypothesis that complexity synchronization occurs between scaling indices or equivalently with the matching of the time dependencies of the networks’ multifractal dimensions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Plants respond to stress through highly tuned regulatory networks. While prior works identified master regulators of iron deficiency responses in A. thaliana from whole-root data, identifying regulators that act at the cellular level is critical to a more comprehensive understanding of iron homeostasis. Within the root epidermis complex molecular mechanisms that facilitate iron reduction and uptake from the rhizosphere are known to be regulated by bHLH transcriptional regulators. However, many questions remain about the regulatory mechanisms that control these responses, and how they may integrate with developmental processes within the epidermis. Here, we use transcriptional profiling to gain insight into root epidermis-specific regulatory processes. Results: Set comparisons of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between whole root and epidermis transcript measurements identified differences in magnitude and timing of organ-level vs. epidermis-specific responses. Utilizing a unique sampling method combined with a mutual information metric across time-lagged and non-time-lagged windows, we identified relationships between clusters of functionally relevant differentially expressed genes suggesting that developmental regulatory processes may act upstream of well-known Fe-specific responses. By integrating static data (DNA motif information) with time-series transcriptomic data and employing machine learning approaches, specifically logistic regression models with LASSO, we also identified putative motifs that served as crucial features for predicting differentially expressed genes. Twenty-eight transcription factors (TFs) known to bind to these motifs were not differentially expressed, indicating that these TFs may be regulated post-transcriptionally or post-translationally. Notably, many of these TFs also play a role in root development and general stress response. Conclusions: This work uncovered key differences in -Fe response identified using whole root data vs. cell-specific root epidermal data. Machine learning approaches combined with additional static data identified putative regulators of -Fe response that would not have been identified solely through transcriptomic profiles and reveal how developmental and general stress responses within the epidermis may act upstream of more specialized -Fe responses for Fe uptake. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This study demonstrates how sequence analysis, which is a method for identifying common patterns in categorical time series data, illuminates the nonlinear dynamics of dyadic conversations by describing chains of behavior that shift categorically, rather than incrementally. When applied to interpersonal interactions, sequence analysis supports the identification of conversational motifs, which can be used to test hypotheses linking patterns of interaction to conversational antecedents or outcomes. As an illustrative example, this study evaluated 285 conversations involving stranger, friend, and dating dyads in which one partner, the discloser, communicated about a source of stress to a partner in the role of listener. Using sequence analysis, we identified three five-turn supportive conversational motifs that had also emerged in a previous study of stranger dyads: discloser problem description, discloser problem processing, and listener-focused dialogue. We also observed a new, fourth motif: listener-focused, discloser questioning. Tests of hypotheses linking the prevalence and timing of particular motifs to the problem discloser’s emotional improvement and perceptions of support quality, as moderated by the discloser’s pre-interaction stress, offered a partial replication of previous findings. The discussion highlights the value of using sequence analysis to illuminate dynamic patterns in dyadic interactions. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {According to the World Health Organization, about 422 million people worldwide have type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D, T2D), with the latter accounting for 90-95% of cases. Safe and effective treatment of patients with diabetes requires accurate and frequent monitoring of their blood sugar levels. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a monitoring technology developed to address this need, and its use among U.S. T1D patients has increased from 6% in 2011 to 38% in 2018 and continues to increase worldwide in both T1D and T2D. This paper presents a data-driven approach to determine Omega, a finite set of representative daily profiles (motifs) such that almost any daily CGM profile generated by a patient can be matched to one of the motifs in Omega. The training data set (9741 profiles) was used to identify 8 candidate sets of motifs, while the validation data set (14 175 profiles) was used to select the final set Omega. The robustness of Omega was established by using it to successfully classify (match against a representative daily profile in Omega) 99.0% of 42 595 daily CGM profiles in the testing data set. All data sets contained daily CGM profiles from six studies involving T1D and T2D patients using a variety of treatment modes, including daily insulin injections, insulin pumps, or artificial pancreas (AP). The classified profiles can be used in predictive modeling, decision support, and automated control systems (e.g., AP). © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis is a widely used approach for capturing brain activation patterns, connectivity states, and network organization. However, a typical sliding window plus clustering (SWC) approach for analyzing dFNC models the system through a fixed sequence of connectivity states. SWC assumes connectivity patterns span throughout the brain, but they are relatively spatially constrained and temporally short-lived in practice. Thus, SWC is neither designed to capture transient dynamic changes nor heterogeneity across subjects/time. We propose a state-space time series summarization framework called “statelets” to address these shortcomings. It models functional connectivity dynamics at fine-grained timescales, adapting time series motifs to changes in connectivity strength, and constructs a concise yet informative representation of the original data that conveys easily comprehensible information about the phenotypes. We leverage the earth mover distance in a nonstandard way to handle scale differences and utilize kernel density estimation to build a probability density profile for local motifs. We apply the framework to study dFNC of patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy control (HC). Results demonstrate SZ subjects exhibit reduced modularity in their brain network organization relative to HC. Statelets in the HC group show an increased recurrence across the dFNC time-course compared to the SZ. Analyzing the consistency of the connections across time reveals significant differences within visual, sensorimotor, and default mode regions where HC subjects show higher consistency than SZ. The introduced approach also enables handling dynamic information in cross-modal and multimodal applications to study healthy and disordered brains. © 2022 The Authors.

However, current state-of-the-art algorithms fall short in their applicability in production environments (due to static motif length, lots of user defined parameters, only providing the best motif pair, etc.). In this paper, a variable length motif discovery method is proposed based on the Matrix Profile which focuses on industrial applicability. It works in noisy and periodic environments, returns only unique motifs (meaning same shape motifs are grouped together as one) and only requires one distance matrix calculation.

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, time series motif discovery has emerged as a useful primitive for many downstream analytical tasks, including clustering, classification, rule discovery, segmentation, and summarization. In parallel, it has long been known that Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is superior to other similarity measures such as Euclidean Distance under most settings. Recently an algorithm to allow scalable DTW motif discovery was proposed; however, it is limited to finding pairs of subsequences whose subsequence lengths are the same. Moreover, that length must be provided by the user ahead of time. In this work, we propose a novel method to discover "warped"motifs whose lengths may differ. Moreover, our method allows input parameters that are not fixed lengths but rather just bounds on the maximum length of motifs to find. This allows us to quickly find different-length motifs without the burdensome trial-and-error of conventional methods. With extensive empirical work, we show that our method is scalable enough for real-world datasets and enables us to find variable-length and "warped"motifs that would otherwise escape the attention of conventional algorithms.  © 2023 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {Due to the diversity of appliances and users’ power consumption behaviors, it is challenging to accurately extract load signature samples for non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) in unseen scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes an enhanced NILM load pattern extraction method via variable-length motif discovery. Firstly, the variable-length motif discovery method is used for the first time to discover similar subsequences from the aggregated power time series to extract power waveform signature (PWS) samples for appliances and obtain the power waveform motifs (PWMs). Furthermore, the appliance PWM sequence pattern mining method is proposed to detect complete power consumption patterns of appliance working cycles, and eventually construct the load signature library. Finally, the similarity between the original PWS samples and the templates in the signature library is measured to realize load identification. In practice, the proposed method is intended to integrate into the incremental learning framework, so that the unknown appliances can be identified gradually by continuous iterative learning. The comparison testing results on the public and private datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively discover various PWMs of different appliances, and accurately model their power consumption patterns, thus exhibiting better performance on the unsupervised load identification compared with the existing methods, especially for the complex appliances. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: The DoG (Delay of Germination1) family plays a key regulatory role in seed dormancy and germination. However, to date, there is no complete genomic overview of the DoG gene family of any economically valuable crop, including moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), and no studies have been conducted to characterize its expression profile. To identify the DoG gene members of moso bamboo (PeDoG) and to investigate their family structural features and tissue expression profile characteristics, a study was conducted. Based on the whole genome and differential transcriptome data, in this investigation, we have scrutinized the physicochemical properties, gene structure, cis-acting elements, phylogenetic relationships, conserved structural (CS) domains, CS motifs and expression patterns of the PeDoG1 family of moso bamboo. Results: The DoG family genes of moso bamboo were found distributed across 16 chromosomal scaffolds with 24 members. All members were found to carry DoG1 structural domains, while 23 members additionally possessed basic leucine zipper (bZIP) structural domains. We could divide the PeDoG genes into three subfamilies based on phylogenetic relationships. Covariance analysis revealed that tandem duplication was the main driver of amplification of the PeDoG genes. The upstream promoter of these genes containing several cis-acting elements indicates a plausible role in abiotic stress and hormone induction. Gene expression pattern according to transcriptome data revealed participation of the PeDoG genes in tissue and organ development. Analysis using Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) tool revealed that the PeDoG gene family is also associated with rapid early shoot growth. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analyses showed a dual role of the PeDoG genes. We found that PeDoGs has a possible role as bZIP transcription factors by regulating Polar like1 (PL1) gene expression, and thereby playing a disease response role in moso bamboo. Quantitative gene expression of the PeDoG genes revealed that they were abundantly expressed in roots and leaves, and could be induced in response to gibberellin (GA). Conclusion: In this study, we found that the PeDoG genes are involved in a wide range of activities such as growth and development, stress response and transcription. This forms the first report of PeDoG genes and their potential roles in moso bamboo. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Edge devices that operate in real-world environments are subjected to unpredictable conditions caused by environmental forces such as wind and uneven surfaces. Since most edge systems such as autonomous vehicles exhibit dynamic properties, it is clear that reinforcement learning can be a powerful tool for improving system accuracy. Successful maintenance of the position of a vehicle in such environments has been recently achieved with the aid of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that dynamically adjusts the Reconfigurable Wireless Network (RWN) response. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often seen as black boxes, as neither the acquired knowledge nor the decision rationale can be explained. This raises issues with the transparency and trustworthiness of the system because the underlying AI models are not governed by any mathematical or physics laws. In this paper, we explain the process of a DNN utilisation in an autonomous dynamic positioning system by gauging reactions of the DNN to predefined constraints and capturing the associated conditions that influence the DNN in a time series. We introduce a novel digitisation technique that reduces interesting patterns of time series data into single-digits to obtain a cross comparable view of the conditions. By analysing the clusters formed on this cross comparable view, we discovered multiple intensities of environmental conditions spanning across 44% of moderate conditions and 33% and 23% of harsh and mild conditions respectively. Our analysis showed that the proposed system can provide stable responses to uncertain conditions by predicting randomness.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Detecting changes in the activity of a transcription factor (TF) in response to a perturbation provides insights into the underlying cellular process. Transcription Factor Enrichment Analysis (TFEA) is a robust and reliable computational method that detects positional motif enrichment associated with changes in transcription observed in response to a perturbation. TFEA detects positional motif enrichment within a list of ranked regions of interest (ROIs), typically sites of RNA polymerase initiation inferred from regulatory data such as nascent transcription. Therefore, we also introduce muMerge, a statistically principled method of generating a consensus list of ROIs from multiple replicates and conditions. TFEA is broadly applicable to data that informs on transcriptional regulation including nascent transcription (eg. PRO-Seq), CAGE, histone ChIP-Seq, and accessibility data (e.g., ATAC-Seq). TFEA not only identifies the key regulators responding to a perturbation, but also temporally unravels regulatory networks with time series data. Consequently, TFEA serves as a hypothesis-generating tool that provides an easy, rigorous, and cost-effective means to broadly assess TF activity yielding new biological insights. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Correlation analysis in the retail industry mainly involves market basket analysis. This kind of correlation analysis of retail product sales does not reflect the information regarding the time or quantity of the sales. Product sales datasets contain rich information about the correlations between different products at different times. The co-occurrence of similar sales subsequences reveal that product sales are correlated in a specific time period. Therefore, searching for similar co-occurrence patterns can help analyze the temporary correlations between products. The search for similar subsequences can be viewed as motif discovery in time-series datasets. In the field of motif discovery, the matrix profile (MP) provides an overwhelming advantage in detecting motifs. In this study, our aim is to discover motifs using MP, and hence, analyze the temporary sales correlations between products. The results of our numerical experiments indicate what products customers will purchase at what time. As opposed to strong association rules, we name the correlation rules in this work as temporary rules (TRs). Our results also show that customers’ preferences are not stable and change with time. In the retail industry, TRs can help business owners make suitable product promotions at appropriate times. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that TRs can extract more interesting information and patterns than mining with association rules. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The recently introduced data structure, the Matrix Profile, annotates a time series by recording the location of and distance to the nearest neighbor of every subsequence. This information trivially provides answers to queries for both time series motifs and time series discords, perhaps two of the most frequently used primitives in time series data mining. One attractive feature of the Matrix Profile is that it completely divorces the high-level details of the analytics performed, from the computational “heavy lifting.” The Matrix Profile can be computed using the appropriate computational paradigm for the task at hand: CPU, GPU, FPGA, distributed computing, anytime computation, incremental computation, and so forth. However, all the details of such computation can be hidden from the analyst who only needs to think about her analytical need. In this work, we expand on this philosophy and ask the following question: If we assume that we get the Matrix Profile for free, what interesting analytics can we do, writing at most ten lines of code? As we will show, the answer is surprisingly large and diverse. Our aim here is not to establish or compete with state-of-the-art results, but merely to show that we can both reproduce the results of many existing algorithms and find novel regularities in time series data collections with very little effort. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The cnidarian model organism Hydra has long been studied for its remarkable ability to regenerate its head, which is controlled by a head organizer located near the hypostome. The canonical Wnt pathway plays a central role in head organizer function during regeneration and during bud formation, which is the asexual mode of reproduction in Hydra. However, it is unclear how shared the developmental programs of head organizer genesis are in budding and regeneration. Time-series analysis of gene expression changes during head regeneration and budding revealed a set of 298 differentially expressed genes during the 48-h head regeneration and 72-h budding time courses. In order to understand the regulatory elements controlling Hydra head regeneration, we first identified 27,137 open-chromatin elements that are open in one or more sections of the organism body or regenerating tissue. We used histone modification ChIP-seq to identify 9,998 candidate proximal promoter and 3,018 candidate enhancer-like regions respectively. We show that a subset of these regulatory elements is dynamically remodeled during head regeneration and identify a set of transcription factor motifs that are enriched in the enhancer regions activated during head regeneration. Our results show that Hydra displays complex gene regulatory structures of developmentally dynamic enhancers, which suggests that the evolution of complex developmental enhancers predates the split of cnidarians and bilaterians. © The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {The low phytic acid (lpa) trait in soybeans can be conferred by loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding myo-inositol phosphate synthase and two epistatically interacting genes encoding multidrug-resistance protein ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. However, perturbations in phytic acid biosynthesis are associated with poor seed vigor. Since the benefits of the lpa trait, in terms of end-use quality and sustainability, far outweigh the negatives associated with poor seed performance, a fuller understanding of the molecular basis behind the negatives will assist crop breeders and engineers in producing variates with lpa and better germination rate. The gene regulatory network (GRN) for developing low and normal phytic acid soybean seeds was previously constructed, with genes modulating a variety of processes pertinent to phytic acid metabolism and seed viability being identified. In this study, a comparative time series analysis of low and normal phytic acid soybeans was carried out to investigate the transcriptional regulatory elements governing the transitional dynamics from dry seed to germinated seed. GRNs were reverse engineered from time series transcriptomic data of three distinct genotypic subsets composed of lpa soybean lines and their normal phytic acid sibling lines. Using a robust unsupervised network inference scheme, putative regulatory interactions were inferred for each subset of genotypes. These interactions were further validated by published regulatory interactions found in Arabidopsis thaliana and motif sequence analysis. Results indicate that lpa seeds have increased sensitivity to stress, which could be due to changes in phytic acid levels, disrupted inositol phosphate signaling, disrupted phosphate ion (Pi) homeostasis, and altered myo-inositol metabolism. Putative regulatory interactions were identified for the latter two processes. Changes in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling candidate transcription factors (TFs) putatively regulating genes in this process were identified as well. Analysis of the GRNs reveal altered regulation in processes that may be affecting the germination of lpa soybean seeds. Therefore, this work contributes to the ongoing effort to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying altered seed viability, germination and field emergence of lpa crops, understanding of which is necessary in order to mitigate these problems. © Copyright © 2021 DeMers, Raboy, Li and Saghai Maroof.},

	abstract = {In the last 15 years, data series motif and discord discovery have emerged as two useful and well-used primitives for data series mining, with applications to many domains, including robotics, entomology, seismology, medicine, and climatology. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art motif and discord discovery tools still require the user to provide the relative length. Yet, in several cases, the choice of length is critical and unforgiving. Unfortunately, the obvious brute-force solution, which tests all lengths within a given range, is computationally untenable. In this work, we introduce a new framework, which provides an exact and scalable motif and discord discovery algorithm that efficiently finds all motifs and discords in a given range of lengths. We evaluate our approach with five diverse real datasets, and demonstrate that it is up to 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art. Our results also show that removing the unrealistic assumption that the user knows the correct length, can often produce more intuitive and actionable results, which could have otherwise been missed. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Time series represent a type of data that is increasingly present in research and industry applications. The most commonly used approach to obtain knowledge from these data is similarity-based data mining algorithms. However, in large volumes of data, applying these algorithms may be infeasible. Therefore, several techniques are proposed in the literature to accelerate the distance calculation between time series, such as algorithms' adaptations, indexing, and approximations. Recent results show that the union of techniques in different categories usually improves efficiency in time series mining tasks by similarity. In this way, we evaluate the dimensionality reduction through convolutional autoencoders to speed up time series distance calculation. To this end, we propose an offline training phase, with data previously observed in other domains, before applying the autoencoders. Our proposal is orthogonal to state-of-the-art tools so that we can use it as a complementary technique. We show that our proposal can lead similarity-based algorithms to execute up to two orders of magnitude faster than these tools alone, without loss of quality in the results obtained through all-pairwise distance calculation, similarity search, and motif discovery. © 2020 IEEE.},

Very often, situations cannot be defined but need to be discovered as recurrent patterns within time series data of the system under consideration. This paper addresses the assessment of different approaches to discover frequent variable-length patterns in time series. Because of the success of artificial neural networks (NN) in various research fields, a special issue of this work is the applicability of NNs to the problem of pattern discovery in time series. Therefore we applied and adapted a Convolutional Autoencoder and compared it to classical nonlearning approaches based on Dynamic Time Warping, based on time series discretization as well as based on the Matrix Profile. These nonlearning approaches have also been adapted, to fulfill our requirements like the discovery of potentially time scaled patterns from noisy time series. We showed the performance (quality, computing time, effort of parametrization) of those approaches in an extensive test with synthetic data sets. Additionally the transferability to other data sets is tested by using real life vehicle data. We demonstrated the ability of Convolutional Autoencoders to discover patterns in an unsupervised way. Furthermore the tests showed, that the Autoencoder is able to discover patterns with a similar quality like classical nonlearning approaches. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Solid-state nanopores have emerged as one of the most versatile tools for single-biomolecule detection and characterization. Nanopore sensing is based on the measurement of variations in ionic current as charged biomolecules immersed in an electrolyte translocate through nanometer-sized channels, in response to an external voltage applied across the membrane. The passage of a biomolecule through a pore yields information about its structure and chemical properties, as demonstrated experimentally with sub-microsecond temporal resolution. However, extracting the sequence of a biomolecule without the information about its position remains challenging due to the fact there is a large variability of sensing events recorded. In this paper, we performed microsecond time scale all-Atom non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of peptide translocation (motifs of alpha-synuclein, associated with Parkinson's disease) through single-layer MoS2 nanopores. First, we present an analysis based on the current threshold to extract and characterize meaningful sensing events from ionic current time series computed from MD. Second, a mechanism of translocation is established, for which side chains of each amino acid are oriented parallel to the electric field when they are translocating through the pore and perpendicular otherwise. Third, a new procedure based on the permutation entropy (PE) algorithm is detailed to identify protein sequence motifs related to ionic current drop speed. PE is a technique used to quantify the complexity of a given time series and it allows the detection of regular patterns. Here, PE patterns were associated with protein sequence motifs composed of 1, 2 or 3 amino acids. Finally, we demonstrate that this very promising procedure allows the detection of biological mutations and could be tested experimentally, despite the fact that reconstructing the sequence information remains unachievable at this time.

Septicemia caused by Aeromonas hydrophila bacteria is currently considered a substantial threat for pacu aquaculture that have provoked infectious disease outbreaks with high economic losses. The understanding of molecular aspects on progress of A. hydrophila infection and pacu immune response is scarce, which have limited the development of genomic selection for resistance to this infection. The present study aimed to generate information on transcriptome of pacu in face of A. hydrophila infection, and compare the transcriptomic responses between two groups of time-series belonging to a disease resistance challenge, peak mortality (HM) and mortality plateau (PM) groups of individuals. Nine RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries were prepared from liver tissue of challenged individuals, generating ∼160 million 150 bp pair-end reads. After quality trimming/cleanup, these reads were assembled de novo generating 211,259 contigs. When the expression of genes from individuals of HM group were compared to individuals from control group, a total of 4,413 differentially expressed transcripts were found (2,000 upregulated and 2,413 downregulated candidate genes). Additionally, 433 transcripts were differentially expressed when individuals from MP group were compared with those in the control group (155 upregulated and 278 downregulated candidate genes). The resulting differentially expressed transcripts were clustered into the following functional categories: cytokines and signaling, epithelial protection, antigen processing and presentation, apoptosis, phagocytosis, complement system cascades and pattern recognition receptors. The proposed results revealing relevant differential gene expression on HM and PM groups which will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular defense mechanisms during A. hydrophila infection. © Copyright © 2020 Mastrochirico-Filho, Hata, Kuradomi, de Freitas, Ariede, Pinheiro, Robledo, Houston and Hashimoto.},

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to learn the semantic representation of a symbol sequence which is generated corresponding to a time-series by an approximation algorithm that can capture the structure of original data. However, the granularity of structure (coarse-to fine-grained) approximated by such an algorithm is defined by a parameter which affects the quality of resulting representation, and therefore impacts the performance of its subsequent tasks. We then propose a multi-granularity substructure-aware representation learning algorithm for time-series (MS-SRALAT) which is an ensemble model that incorporates the trained models with different granularity to produce more robust representations. The resulted experiments on the benchmark datasets showed the superiority of MS-SRALAT over single-granularity learning models, and comparable performances compared to the exact baseline methods while suggesting good scalability for the similar search task.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Manufacturers are increasingly interested in applying machine and deep learning to automate quality control monitoring to save time and costs. A typical approach is the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to assess and classify quality issues in images of the production outputs. However, many companies report project challenges and prohibitive computational costs. The challenges arise because of lack of big data required for machine and deep learning model training and lack of data scientists with domain knowledge to build and run complex models. Today manufacturers operate at six sigma levels of quality, and thus have extremely few defect samples. In many cases production changes frequently, and thus the data collection and model training have to be re-done for the new outputs. In this paper we propose two approaches - motif discovery from small sample data and visual motif discovery being simple and intuitive for any engineer to use. We compare them for ease of use and computational efficiency with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and conclude that our proposed approach significantly improves the existing performance, provides fast and reliable training with small samples, and empowers engineers to do it themselves (DIY). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The steel industry is a basic industry of the national economy, and its product structure is complicated. Due to price differences, the prices of products of different varieties, specifications and origins affect each other and transmit each other. In addition, the steel industry covers the stages of product selection, smelting and processing. The transmission patterns between product prices at different stages also vary. At the same time, the steel industry has been confirmed to be a typical cyclical industry. Thus, our work mainly explores the transmission relationship between steel product prices under multiple timescales from the perspective of the industrial chain. First, we use discrete wavelet transform to extract the time series of 553 steel products at different timescales. Second, based on the Granger causality test, the transmission relationship between every two products is measured. Third, by constructing multiscale steel product price transmission networks, important steel products with different roles are identified. Finally, based on motif recognition, the main modes of product price transmission between different reaches of the industrial chain are summarized. The results show that as the timescale increases, the transmission between products becomes increasingly frequent and that the transmission patterns become increasingly clear. In general, there is a high probability of occurrence of important steel products in hot rolled coils, structural steel and medium and heavy plates, especially 4.75 mm and 3 mm hot rolled coils produced in Beijing and 4.75 mm hot rolled coils produced in Beijing and Zhengzhou. In addition, the transmission of steel products at different stages has undergone a process of transmission between two stages to transmission among three stages and then to transmission between two stages. In this regard, under 4–8 days, transmission within a stage and transmission among three stages is the most frequent transmission pattern. Our work will help investors and policy makers gain an in-depth understanding of the steel market and mitigate risks in investment and the policy development process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In technical systems the analysis of similar load situations is a promising technique to gain information about the system's state, its health or wearing. Very often, load situations are challenging to be defined by hand. Hence, these situations need to be discovered as recurrent patterns within multivariate time series data of the system under consideration. Unsupervised algorithms for finding such recurrent patterns in multivariate time series must be able to cope with very large data sets because the system might be observed over a very long time. In our previous work we identified discretization-based approaches to be very interesting for variable length pattern discovery because of their low computing time due to the simplification (symbolization) of the time series. In this paper we propose additional preprocessing steps for symbolic representation of time series aiming for enhanced multivariate pattern discovery. Beyond that we show the performance (quality and computing time) of our algorithms in a synthetic test data set as well as in a real life example with 100 millions of time points. We also test our approach with increasing dimensionality of the time series. © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

The triadic MDF-FCN classifier gives the best result in the test. Furthermore, the MDF-FCN classifier is used for the malfunctioning industrial machine investigation and inspection sound dataset (MIMII).

	abstract = {Background: The BBX (B-box) family are zinc finger protein (ZFP) transcription factors that play an essential role in plant growth, development and response to abiotic stresses. Although BBX genes have been characterized in many model organisms, genome-wide identification of the BBX family genes have not yet been reported in Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), and the biological functions of this family remain unknown. Result: In the present study, we identified 27 BBX genes in the genome of Moso bamboo, and analysis of their conserved motifs and multiple sequence alignments revealed that they all shared highly similar structures. Additionally, phylogenetic and homology analyses indicated that PeBBX genes were divided into three clusters, with whole-genome duplication (WGD) events having facilitated the expansion of this gene family. Light-responsive and stress-related cis-elements were identified by analyzing cis-elements in the promoters of all PeBBX genes. Short time-series expression miner (STEM) analysis revealed that the PeBBX genes had spatiotemporal-specific expression patterns and were likely involved in the growth and development of bamboo shoots. We further explored the downstream target genes of PeBBXs, and GO/KEGG enrichment analysis predicted multiple functions of BBX target genes, including those encoding enzymes involved in plant photosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Conclusions: In conclusion, we analyzed the PeBBX genes at multiple different levels, which will contribute to further studies of the BBX family and provide valuable information for the functional validation of this family. © 2021, The Author(s).},

At the same time, however, more and more building monitoring data is being collected. The manual evaluation of this data is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Hence, there is a strong need for tools that enable the automatic knowledge extraction from these huge data sets to support system integrators and favor the development of smart energy services, e.g., predictive maintenance. One crucial step in knowledge extraction is the detection of change points and hidden states in measurements. In this work, we present a tool for automated detection of hidden operation modes based on multivariate time series data deploying motif-aware state assignment (MASA). The tool is evaluated utilizing measurements of a heat pump and compared to two baseline algorithms, namely k-Means and k-Medoids. MASA performs particularly well on noisy data, where it shows only a small deviation in the number of detected change points compared to the ground truth with up to 77 % accuracy. Furthermore, it almost always outperforms the baseline algorithms, which in turn require extensive preprocessing. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.},

Recently, the Matrix Profile method, and particularly two of its Euclidean-distance-based implementations-SCRIMP and SCAMP-have become the state-of-The-Art approaches in this field. Those algorithms bring the possibility of obtaining exact motifs and discords from a time series, which can be used to infer events, predict outcomes, detect anomalies and more. While matrix profile is embarrassingly parallelizable, we find that autovectorization techniques fail to fully exploit the SIMD capabilities of modern CPU architectures. In this paper, we develop custom-vectorized SCRIMP and SCAMP implementations based on AVX2 and AVX-512 extensions, which we combine with multithreading techniques aimed at exploiting the potential of the underneath architectures. Our experimental evaluation, conducted using real data, shows a performance improvement of more than 4× with respect to the autovectorization.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to be modulated by membrane cholesterol levels, but whether or not the effects are caused by specific receptor-cholesterol interactions or cholesterol's general effects on the membrane is not well-understood. We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations coupled with structural bioinformatics approaches on the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor subfamily. The β2AR has been shown to be sensitive to membrane cholesterol and cholesterol molecules have been clearly resolved in numerous β2AR crystal structures. The two CCK receptors are highly homologous and preserve similar cholesterol recognition motifs but despite their homology, CCK1R shows functional sensitivity to membrane cholesterol while CCK2R does not. Our results offer new insights into how cholesterol modulates GPCR function by showing cholesterol interactions with β2AR that agree with previously published data; additionally, we observe differential and specific cholesterol binding in the CCK receptor subfamily while revealing a previously unreported Cholesterol Recognition Amino-acid Consensus (CRAC) sequence that is also conserved across 38% of class A GPCRs. A thermal denaturation assay (LCP-Tm) shows that mutation of a conserved CRAC sequence on TM7 of the β2AR affects cholesterol stabilization of the receptor in a lipid bilayer. The results of this study provide a better understanding of receptor-cholesterol interactions that can contribute to novel and improved therapeutics for a variety of diseases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Principally, the basic topological properties of complex networks such as Average Clustering Coefficient (ACC), Average Path Length (APL), and degree distribution are taken into account as macroscopic measurement indexes to roughly classify the loads into three categories. To attain better results, the tetradic motif occurrence frequency is introduced as a mesoscopic measurement index to explore the inherent structure of load time series.

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies and the underpinning blockchain technology have gained unprecedented public attention recently. In contrast to fiat currencies, transactions of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, are permanently recorded on distributed ledgers to be seen by the public. As a result, public availability of all cryptocurrency transactions allows us to create a complex network of financial interactions that can be used to study not only the blockchain graph, but also the relationship between various blockchain network features and cryptocurrency risk investment. We introduce a novel concept of chainlets, or blockchain motifs, to utilize this information. Chainlets allow us to evaluate the role of local topological structure of the blockchain on the joint Bitcoin and Litecoin price formation and dynamics. We investigate the predictive Granger causality of chainlets and identify certain types of chainlets that exhibit the highest predictive influence on cryptocurrency price and investment risk. More generally, while statistical aspects of blockchain data analytics remain virtually unexplored, the paper aims to highlight various emerging theoretical, methodological and applied research challenges of blockchain data analysis that will be of interest to the broad statistical community.

Several approaches for the identification of similar behaviour patterns (or motifs) are proposed, illustrated, and the results discussed. While the MP is primarily designed for single series analysis, it can also be applied to multi-variate financial series. It still permits the initial identification of time periods with indicatively similar behaviour across individual market sectors and indexes, together with the assessment of wider applications, such as general market behaviour in times of financial crisis. In short, the MP algorithm offers considerable potential for detailed analysis, not only in terms of motif identification in financial time series, but also in terms of exploring the nature of underlying events. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The causal inference method based on the time-series analysis has been subject to intense scrutiny, by which the interaction has been revealed between gold and the dollar. The positive or negative causality between them has been captured by the existing methods. However, the dynamic interactions are time-varying rather than immutable, i.e., the evolution of the causality between gold and the dollar is likely to be covered by the statistical process. In this article, a method which combines the pattern causality and the state-transition network is developed to identify the characteristics of the causality evolution between gold and the dollar. Based on this method, we can identify not only the causality intensity but also the causality type, including the types of positive causality, negative causality and the third causality (dark causality). Furthermore, the patterns of the causalities for the segments of the bivariate time series are transformed to a state-transition network from which the characteristics in the evolution of the causality have also been identified. The results show that the causality has some prominent motifs over time, that are the states of negative causality. More interestingly, the states that act as a bridge in the transition between states are also negative causality. Therefore, our findings provide a new perspective to explain the relatively stable negative causality between gold and the dollar from the evolution of causality. It can also help market participants understand and monitor the dynamic process of causality between gold and the dollar. © 2022. the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

	abstract = {Tissue morphogenesis relies on repeated use of dynamic behaviors at the levels of intracellular structures, individual cells, and cell groups. Rapidly accumulating live imaging datasets make it increasingly important to formalize and automate the task of mapping recurrent dynamic behaviors (motifs), as it is done in speech recognition and other data mining applications. Here, we present a “template-based search” approach for accurate mapping of sub- to multi-cellular morphogenetic motifs using a time series data mining framework. We formulated the task of motif mapping as a subsequence matching problem and solved it using dynamic time warping, while relying on high throughput graph-theoretic algorithms for efficient exploration of the search space. This formulation allows our algorithm to accurately identify the complete duration of each instance and automatically label different stages throughout its progress, such as cell cycle phases during cell division. To illustrate our approach, we mapped cell intercalations during germband extension in the early Drosophila embryo. Our framework enabled statistical analysis of intercalary cell behaviors in wild-type and mutant embryos, comparison of temporal dynamics in contracting and growing junctions in different genotypes, and the identification of a novel mode of iterative cell intercalation. Our formulation of tissue morphogenesis using time series opens new avenues for systematic decomposition of tissue morphogenesis. © 2020 Stern et al.

However, the massive size and continuous nature of these networks make them fundamentally challenging to analyze and leverage for descriptive and predictive modeling tasks.

We develop online, single-pass sampling algorithms, and unbiased estimators for temporal network sampling. The proposed algorithms enable fast, accurate, and memory-efficient statistical estimation of temporal network patterns and properties. In addition, we propose a temporally decaying sampling algorithm with unbiased estimators for studying networks that evolve in continuous time, where the strength of links is a function of time, and the motif patterns are temporally weighted. In contrast to the prior notion of a ĝ-3 toral motif, the proposed formulation and algorithms for counting temporally weighted motifs are useful for forecasting tasks in networks such as predicting future links, or a future time-series variable of nodes and links. Finally, extensive experiments on a variety of temporal networks from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. A detailed ablation study is provided to understand the impact of the various components of the proposed framework.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {In recent years, time series motif discovery has emerged as perhaps the most important primitive for many analytical tasks, including clustering, classification, rule discovery, segmentation, and summarization. In parallel, it has long been known that Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is superior to other similarity measures such as Euclidean Distance under most settings. However, due to the computational complexity of both DTW and motif discovery, virtually no research efforts have been directed at combining these two ideas. The current best mechanisms to address their lethargy appear to be mutually incompatible. In this work, we present the first efficient, scalable and exact method to find time series motifs under DTW. Our method automatically performs the best trade-off of time-to-compute versus tightness-of-lower-bounds for a novel hierarchy of lower bounds that we introduce. As we shall show through extensive experiments, our algorithm prunes up to 99.99% of the DTW computations under realistic settings and is up to three to four orders of magnitude faster than the brute force search, and two orders of magnitude faster than the only other competitor algorithm. This allows us to discover DTW motifs in massive datasets for the first time. As we will show, in many domains, DTW-based motifs represent semantically meaningful conserved behavior that would escape our attention using all existing Euclidean distance-based methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The role of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) signaling in Igh recombination has been difficult to partition from its role in B cell survival and proliferation. With a detailed description of the Igh repertoire in murine IL-7Rα−/− bone marrow B cells, we demonstrate that IL-7R signaling profoundly influences VH gene selection during VH-to-DJH recombination. We find skewing toward 3′ VH genes during de novo VH-to-DJH recombination more severe than the fetal liver (FL) repertoire and uncover a role for IL-7R signaling in DH-to-JH recombination. Transcriptome and accessibility analyses suggest reduced expression of B lineage transcription factors (TFs) and targets and loss of DH and VH antisense transcription in IL-7Rα−/− B cells. Thus, in addition to its roles in survival and proliferation, IL-7R signaling shapes the Igh repertoire by activating underpinning mechanisms. © 2021 The Authors},

An excellent high-level link prediction algorithm can not only mine the potential relationship between nodes in a complex network but also help to understand the law of network structure evolves over time. Exploring unknown network relationships has important applications. Most traditional link prediction algorithms only consider the structural similarity between nodes, while ignoring the characteristics of higher-order structures and information about network changes. This study proposes a high-order link prediction model based on Motif clustering coefficients and time series partitioning (MTLP). This model constructs a representational feature vector by extracting the features of Motif clustering coefficients and network structure evolution of high-order structures in the network, and uses multilayer perceptron (MLP) network model to complete the link prediction task. By conducting experiments on different real-life data sets, the results show that the proposed MTLP model has better high-order link prediction performance than the state-of-the-art methods. © Copyright 2021, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {High rates of biodiversity loss caused by human-induced changes in the environment require new methods for large scale fauna monitoring and data analysis. While ecoacoustic monitoring is increasingly being used and shows promise, analysis and interpretation of the big data produced remains a challenge. Computer-generated acoustic indices potentially provide a biologically meaningful summary of sound, however, temporal autocorrelation, difficulties in statistical analysis of multi-index data and lack of consistency or transferability in different terrestrial environments have hindered the application of those indices in different contexts. To address these issues we investigate the use of time-series motif discovery and random forest classification of multi-indices through two case studies. We use a semi-automated workflow combining time-series motif discovery and random forest classification of multi-index (acoustic complexity, temporal entropy, and events per second) data to categorize sounds in unfiltered recordings according to the main source of sound present (birds, insects, geophony). Our approach showed more than 70% accuracy in label assignment in both datasets. The categories assigned were broad, but we believe this is a great improvement on traditional single index analysis of environmental recordings as we can now give ecological meaning to recordings in a semi-automated way that does not require expert knowledge and manual validation is only necessary for a small subset of the data. Furthermore, temporal autocorrelation, which is largely ignored by researchers, has been effectively eliminated through the time-series motif discovery technique applied here for the first time to ecoacoustic data. We expect that our approach will greatly assist researchers in the future as it will allow large datasets to be rapidly processed and labeled, enabling the screening of recordings for undesired sounds, such as wind, or target biophony (insects and birds) for biodiversity monitoring or bioacoustics research.

	abstract = {Background: Increased acute postoperative pain intensity has been associated with the development of persistent postsurgical pain (PPP) in mechanistic and clinical investigations, but it remains unclear which aspects of acute pain explain this linkage. Methods: We analysed clinical postoperative pain intensity assessments using symbolic aggregate approximations (SAX), a graphical way of representing changes between pain states from one patient evaluation to the next, to visualize and understand how pain intensity changes across sequential assessments are associated with the intensity of postoperative pain at 1 (M1) and 6 (M6) months after surgery. SAX-based acute pain transition patterns were compared using cosine similarity, which indicates the degree to which patterns mirror each other. Results: This single-centre prospective cohort study included 364 subjects. Patterns of acute postoperative pain sequential transitions differed between the ‘None’ and ‘Severe’ outcomes at M1 (cosine similarity 0.44) and M6 (cosine similarity 0.49). Stratifications of M6 outcomes by preoperative pain intensity, sex, age group, surgery type and catastrophising showed significant heterogeneity of pain transition patterns within and across strata. Severe-to-severe acute pain transitions were common, but not exclusive, in patients with moderate or severe pain intensity at M6. Conclusions: Clinically, these results suggest that individual pain-state transitions, even within patient or procedural strata associated with PPP, may not alone offer good predictive information regarding PPP. Longitudinal observation in the immediate postoperative period and consideration of patient- and surgery-specific factors may help indicate which patients are at increased risk of PPP. Significance: Symbolic aggregate approximations of clinically obtained, acute postoperative pain intraday time series identify different motifs in patients suffering moderate to severe pain 6 months after surgery. © 2020 European Pain Federation - EFIC®},

	abstract = {Individual cells show variability in their signaling dynamics that often correlates with phenotypic responses, indicating that cell-to-cell variability is not merely noise but can have functional consequences. Based on this observation, we reasoned that cell-to-cell variability under the same treatment condition could be explained in part by a single signaling motif that maps different upstream signals into a corresponding set of downstream responses. If this assumption holds, then repeated measurements of upstream and downstream signaling dynamics in a population of cells could provide information about the underlying signaling motif for a given pathway, even when no prior knowledge of that motif exists. To test these two hypotheses, we developed a computer algorithm called MISC (Motif Inference from Single Cells) that infers the underlying signaling motif from paired time-series measurements from individual cells. When applied to measurements of transcription factor and reporter gene expression in the yeast stress response, MISC predicted signaling motifs that were consistent with previous mechanistic models of transcription. The ability to detect the underlying mechanism became less certain when a cell's upstream signal was randomly paired with another cell's downstream response, demonstrating how averaging time-series measurements across a population obscures information about the underlying signaling mechanism.

	abstract = {Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly important to monitor the mutations that arise in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to prepare public health strategies and guide the further development of vaccines and therapeutics. The spike (S) protein and the proteins comprising the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) are key vaccine and drug targets, respectively, making mutation surveillance of these proteins of great importance. Full protein sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database, aligned, and the variants identified. 437,006 unique viral genomes were analyzed. Polymorphisms in the protein sequence were investigated and examined longitudinally to identify sequence and strain variants appearing between January 5th, 2020 and January 16th, 2021. A structural analysis was also performed to investigate mutations in the receptor binding domain and the N-terminal domain of the spike protein. Within the spike protein, there were 766 unique mutations observed in the N-terminal domain and 360 in the receptor binding domain. Four residues that directly contact ACE2 were mutated in more than 100 sequences, including positions K417, Y453, S494, and N501. Within the furin cleavage site of the spike protein, a high degree of conservation was observed, but the P681H mutation was observed in 10.47% of sequences analyzed. Within the RNA dependent RNA polymerase complex proteins, 327 unique mutations were observed in Nsp8, 166 unique mutations were observed in Nsp7, and 1157 unique mutations were observed in Nsp12. Only 4 sequences analyzed contained mutations in the 9 residues that directly interact with the therapeutic Remdesivir, suggesting limited mutations in drug interacting residues. The identification of new variants emphasizes the need for further study on the effects of the mutations and the implications of increased prevalence, particularly for vaccine or therapeutic efficacy. © 2021 The Authors},

The most conventional methods are several issues: (1) they need labeled data. (2) they only classify data but not extract the structure of data. (3) they require a window size of time series in advance. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised pattern discovery method which extracts a series of repetitive actions by recognizing basic actions in time series. Hie proposed method consists of a basic action enumeration process and a grammatical inference process. The former discovers the subsequence of basic actions using the Motif discovery method. The latter discovers grammatical patterns constructed with the sequence of the basic actions. Furthermore, we evaluate the accuracy of extracted basic actions and the duration time of a series of actions for packing operations and screw-tightening operations  © 2021 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.},

Applications of ES extraction include the analysis of time series data, preprocessing of imitation learning, and preprocessing of transfer learning. Currently, pairwise incremental search (PIS) is the fastest method to extract ESs; however, a combinatorial explosion can occur when employing this method. In this paper, we show that combinatorial explosion is a problem that occurs in the PIS, and we propose a new method where this problem does not occur. We evaluate the proposed method via experiments; the results show that our proposed method is 39 times faster than the PIS for synthetic datasets where a 20-dimensional ES exists. For the experiment using video datasets, the proposed method enabled us to obtain a 29-dimensional ES, whereas the PIS did not because the memory usage reached its limit when the number of dimensions was 9. In this experiment, the total processing time for our proposed method up to 29 dimensions was 6.3 times shorter than that for PIS up to even 8 dimensions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Uncovering how transcription factors regulate their targets at DNA, RNA and protein levels over time is critical to define gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and assign mechanisms in normal and diseased states. RNA-seq is a standard method measuring gene regulation using an established set of analysis stages. However, none of the currently available pipeline methods for interpreting ordered genomic data (in time or space) use time-series models to assign cause and effect relationships within GRNs, are adaptive to diverse experimental designs, or enable user interpretation through a web-based platform. Furthermore, methods integrating ordered RNA-seq data with protein-DNA binding data to distinguish direct from indirect interactions are urgently needed. We present TIMEOR (Trajectory Inference and Mechanism Exploration with Omics data in R), the first web-based and adaptive time-series multi-omics pipeline method which infers the relationship between gene regulatory events across time. TIMEOR addresses the critical need for methods to determine causal regulatory mechanism networks by leveraging time-series RNA-seq, motif analysis, protein-DNA binding data, and protein-protein interaction networks. TIMEOR's user-catered approach helps non-coders generate new hypotheses and validate known mechanisms. We used TIMEOR to identify a novel link between insulin stimulation and the circadian rhythm cycle.

This enables novel business use cases, such as the digital twin, customer individual production, and data market places. However, the inter-connectivity such use cases rely on also significantly increases the attack surface of industrial enterprises. Sabotage and espionage are aimed at data, which is becoming the most crucial asset of an enterprise. Since the requirements on security solutions in industrial networks are inherently different from office networks, novel approaches for intrusion detection need to be developed. In this work, process data of a real water treatment process that contains attacks is analysed. Analysis is performed by an extension of Matrix Profiles, a motif discovery algorithm for time series. By extending Matrix Profiles with a Hamming-distance metric, binary and tertiary actuators can be integrated into the analysis in a meaningful fashion. This algorithm requires low training effort while providing accurate results. Furthermore, it can be employed in a real-time fashion.

	abstract = {As a newly developed method, the natural visibility graph (NVG) has attracted great attention. Most of the previous research focuses on exploring the time series using the NVG from the angle of the complex network while few efforts have been paid to the degree sequence of the NVG. Recently, two studies indicate that the degree sequence of the horizontal visibility graph (HVG) represents the local motif information of the time series and utilize it to classify time series. Though the performance of the HVG-based classification algorithm is not satisfying, we would like to further explore whether the degree sequence of the NVG could be utilized in practical applications. Hence, we propose the concept of natural visibility encoding for the time series to extract the motif information from the time series through the NVG transformation. To obtain the local motif information from the whole time series, a moving window encoding strategy is also developed. The stock trend prediction (STP) problem is selected as the application area and a universal STP framework is proposed based on the natural visibility encoding and the moving window strategy. By conducting three experiments with over twenty baseline algorithms and the ablation study, the validation, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed framework are proven. The success of the proposed framework suggests that the degree sequence of the NVG transformation could provide useful information for practical usage. We hope our work could inspire further efforts on investigating the degree sequence of the NVG transformation in the dimension of time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

In a similar spirit, we propose a state-space data mining approach called 'statelets.' It is a probabilistic pattern-summarization framework operating on time series correlations and capturing their dynamics. Statelets rely on earth mover distance (EMD): a simple yet effective similarity metric that provides a scale-independent, variable-length comparison between substructures and accounts for partial matching. The efficiency of computing EMD supports its application in a kernel density estimator to approximate local motifs' probability density across the dataset. We validate statelets' utility on the dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The typical approach to the dFNC analysis, sliding window plus clustering (SWC), models the system continuously through a fixed set of connectivity states. Here, rather than using all the time points and searching for the patterns that span throughout the brain, we adopt time series motifs to capture the most recurring and transient patterns of the signals. Statelets produce the synopsis of dynamic connectivity shapes from both dynamics that provide valuable insights into the human brain's dynamic features. We observe these state-shapes are highly informative about the disorder. Also, they reveal significant group differences in connectivity strength across various regions of the brain.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Then, the correlations are used as sample weights for the conditional linear programming (CLP) of CCNQR. To optimize the performance of PIs, a composite evaluation including the accuracy of PI coverage probability (PICP), the average width (AW), and the offsets of points outside PIs (OPOPI) is used to quantify the appropriate upper and lower bounds. Moreover, the adaptive boundary quantiles (ABQs) are quantified for the optimal performance of PIs. Finally, based on the real wind farm data, the superiority of the proposed method is verified by adequate comparisons with the conventional methods. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute.},

However, relatively little is known about the features that receivers extract to decipher relevant social information. Here, we took an expansive, bottom-up approach to delineate the feature space that could be important for processing social information in zebra finch song. Using operant techniques, we discovered that female zebra finches can consistently discriminate brief song phrases (“motifs”) from different social contexts. We then applied machine learning algorithms to classify motifs based on thousands of time-series features and to uncover acoustic features for motif discrimination. In addition to highlighting classic acoustic features, the resulting algorithm revealed novel features for song discrimination, for example, measures of time irreversibility (i.e., the degree to which the statistical properties of the actual and time-reversed signal differ). Moreover, the algorithm accurately predicted female performance on individual motif exemplars. These data underscore and expand the promise of broad time-series phenotyping to acoustic analyses and social decision-making. © 2021 Paul et al.

This paper proposes a fast algorithm named MultiPAL to join multiple time series at interactive speed to summarize large time series datasets. The algorithm exploits Matrix Profiles of the individual time series to enable a greedy search over possible joins. The algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the exact solution and can utilize hundreds of Matrix Profiles.

	abstract = {Currently, big sensor data arise in a wide spectrum of Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, and Smart City applications. In such subject domains, sensors tend to have a high frequency and produce massive time series in a relatively short time interval. The data collected from the sensors are subject to mining in order to make strategic decisions. In the article, we consider the problem of choosing a Time Series Database Management System (TSDBMS) to provide efficient storing and mining of big sensor data. We overview InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, and TimescaleDB, which are among the most popular state-of-the-art TSDBMSs, and represent different categories of such systems, namely native, add-ons over NoSQL systems, and add-ons over relational DBMSs (RDBMSs), respectively. Our overview shows that, at present, TSDBMSs offer a modest built-in toolset to mine big sensor data. This leads to the use of third-party mining systems and unwanted overhead costs due to exporting data outside a TSDBMS, data conversion, and so on. We propose an approach to managing and mining sensor data inside RDBMSs that exploits the Matrix Profile concept. A Matrix Profile is a data structure that annotates a time series through the index of and the distance to the nearest neighbor of each subsequence of the time series and serves as a basis to discover motifs, anomalies, and other time-series data mining primitives. This approach is implemented as a PostgreSQL extension that allows an application programmer both to compute matrix profiles and mining primitives and to represent them as relational tables. Experimental case studies show that our approach surpasses the above-mentioned out-of-TSDBMS competitors in terms of performance since it assumes that sensor data are mined inside a TSDBMS at no significant overhead costs. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species are the dominant species in the microbiota of cold-stored modified-atmosphere-packaged food products and are the main cause of food spoilage. Despite the importance of psychrotrophic LAB, their response to cold or heat has not been studied. Here, we studied the transcriptome-level cold- and heat-shock response of spoilage lactic acid bacteria with time-series RNA-seq for Le. gelidum, Lc. piscium, and P. oligofermentans at 0 °C, 4 °C, 14 °C, 25 °C, and 28 °C. Results: We observed that the cold-shock protein A (cspA) gene was the main cold-shock protein gene in all three species. Our results indicated that DEAD-box RNA helicase genes (cshA, cshB) also play a critical role in cold-shock response in psychrotrophic LAB. In addition, several RNase genes were involved in cold-shock response in Lc. piscium and P. oligofermentans. Moreover, gene network inference analysis provided candidate genes involved in cold-shock response. Ribosomal proteins, tRNA modification, rRNA modification, and ABC and efflux MFS transporter genes clustered with cold-shock response genes in all three species, indicating that these genes could be part of the cold-shock response machinery. Heat-shock treatment caused upregulation of Clp protease and chaperone genes in all three species. We identified transcription binding site motifs for heat-shock response genes in Le. gelidum and Lc. piscium. Finally, we showed that food spoilage-related genes were upregulated at cold temperatures. Conclusions: The results of this study provide new insights on the cold- and heat-shock response of psychrotrophic LAB. In addition, candidate genes involved in cold- and heat-shock response predicted using gene network inference analysis could be used as targets for future studies. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Recently, the display and use of the rainbow flag in historically defined gay neighborhoods has grown even as gay residents and businesses have been driven away by gentrification, rising real-estate costs, and cultural homogenization. At the same time, prevelence and use of the rainbow flag and the rainbow motif has increased in areas not usually considered part of recognized gay neighborhoods. This chapter explores the prevalence and persistence of the display of the rainbow flag and rainbow motif in nine neighborhoods across Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The visual assessment of rainbow flag use across these neighborhoods serves as a potential model for examining the rate of spread of rainbow flags and visual rainbow motif symbols as a means for tracking the movement of the LGBTQ+ community across urban neighborhoods. Initial results suggest potential significance of the prevalence and persistence of the rainbow flag and the rainbow motif. These include; (1) a possible diaspora of LGBTQ+ residents from traditionally defined gay neighborhoods to newly emerging gay or LGBTQ-friendly neighborhoods, (2) a newfound inclusivity or pride among residents of other neighborhoods, and (3) “rainbow washing” due to overuse of the rainbow motif by non-LGBTQ businesses and organizations connected with pride celebrations. While overuse of the rainbow flag may diminish historically coded meaning of the rainbow, that well-intentioned use of the rainbow flag is a positive and welcoming indicator for LGBTQ+ individuals and it may lead to the emergence of additional LGBTQ-friendly enclaves that, over time, could potentially emerge as new gay neighborhoods. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been proposed as a potential physical rehabilitation technology. However, the low classification accuracy achievable with MI tasks is still a challenge when building effective BCI systems. We propose a novel MI classification model based on measurement of functional connectivity between brain regions and graph theory. Specifically, motifs describing local network structures in the brain are extracted from functional connectivity graphs. A graph embedding model called Ego-CNNs is then used to build a classifier, which can convert the graph from a structural representation to a fixed-dimensional vector for detecting critical structure in the graph. We validate our proposed method on four datasets, and the results show that our proposed method produces high classification accuracies in two-class classification tasks (92.8% for dataset 1, 93.4% for dataset 2, 96.5% for dataset 3, and 80.2% for dataset 4) and multiclass classification tasks (90.33% for dataset 1). Our proposed method achieves a mean Kappa value of 0.88 across nine participants, which is superior to other methods we compared it to. These results indicate that there is a local structural difference in functional connectivity graphs extracted under different motor imagery tasks. Our proposed method has great potential for motor imagery classification in future studies. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.},

	abstract = {Time irreversibility of a time series, which can be defined as the variance of properties under the time-reversal transformation, is a cardinal property of non-equilibrium systems and is associated with predictability in the study of financial time series. Recent pieces of literature have proposed the visibility-graph-based approaches that specifically refer to topological properties of the network mapped from a time series, with which one can quantify different degrees of time irreversibility within the sets of statistically time-asymmetric series. However, all these studies have inadequacies in capturing the time irreversibility of some important classes of time series. Here, we extend the visibility-graph-based method by introducing a degree vector associated with network nodes to represent the characteristic patterns of the index motion. The newly proposed method is parameter-free and temporally local. The validation to canonical synthetic time series, in the aspect of time (ir)reversibility, illustrates that our method can differentiate a non-Markovian additive random walk from an unbiased Markovian walk, as well as a GARCH time series from an unbiased multiplicative random walk. We further apply the method to the real-world financial time series and find that the price motions occasionally equip much higher time irreversibility than the calibrated GARCH model does.

	abstract = {Background: Moso bamboo, the fastest growing plant on earth, is an important source for income in large areas of Asia, mainly cultivated in China. Lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD) proteins, a family of transcription factors unique to plants, are involved in multiple transcriptional regulatory pathways and play important roles in lateral organ development, pathogen response, secondary growth, and hormone response. The LBD gene family has not previously been characterized in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis). Results: In this study, we identified 55 members of the LBD gene family from moso bamboo and found that they were distributed non-uniformly across its 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the moso bamboo LBD genes could be divided into two classes. LBDs from the same class share relatively conserved gene structures and sequences encoding similar amino acids. A large number of hormone response–associated cis-regulatory elements were identified in the LBD upstream promoter sequences. Synteny analysis indicated that LBDs in the moso bamboo genome showed greater collinearity with those of O. sativa (rice) and Zea mays (maize) than with those of Arabidopsis and Capsicum annuum (pepper). Numerous segmental duplicates were found in the moso bamboo LBD gene family. Gene expression profiles in four tissues showed that the LBD genes had different spatial expression patterns. qRT–PCR assays with the Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) temporal expression analysis demonstrated that six genes (PeLBD20, PeLBD29, PeLBD46, PeLBD10, PeLBD38, and PeLBD06) were consistently up-regulated during the rapid growth and development of bamboo shoots. In addition, 248 candidate target genes that function in a variety of pathways were identified based on consensus LBD binding motifs. Conclusions: In the current study, we identified 55 members of the moso bamboo transcription factor LBD and characterized for the first time. Based on the short-time sequence expression software and RNA-seq data, the PeLBD gene expression was analyzed. We also investigated the functional annotation of all PeLBDs, including PPI network, GO, and KEGG enrichment based on String database. These results provide a theoretical basis and candidate genes for studying the molecular breeding mechanism of rapid growth of moso bamboo. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The task of finding similar patterns in a long time series, commonly called motifs, has received continuous and increasing attention from diverse scientific fields. Although numerous approaches have been proposed for motif discovery, they cannot discover the motifs in an exact and efficient manner. Furthermore, domain knowledge is required from the experts for those methods to predefine the pattern length, which is also quite objective. In addiction, it is very time-consuming to extract the exact motifs and sometimes the extracted motif has no specific meanings. Especially in the field of financial and hydrology, many studies are focused on whether there is a fixed pattern including trend information hidden in the data. To address the above problems, we proposed a framework to automatically discovery the trend motifs without predefining the length of patterns. It has four main steps, (1) singular spectrum analysis is first applied to removed noise; (2) segmentation by extracting extreme points is then employed to automatically obtain the unequal length of time series pattern; (3) symbolic aggregate approximation is introduced to discretize the data and transform them into string sequences; (4) finally, the trend motifs are selected by measuring their similarity. Experimental results on the real-world time-series datasets reveal that our framework fit well in different circumstances, indicating our proposed framework is effective for trend motif discovery.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem — sitting on a chair for a prolonged time is considered a significant risk factor. Furthermore, the level of LBP may vary at different times of the day. However, the role of the time-sequence property of sitting behavior in relation to LBP has not been considered. During the dynamic sitting, small changes, such as slight or big sways, have been identified. Therefore, it is possible to identify the motif consisting of such changes, which may be associated with the incidence, exacerbation, or improvement of LBP. Method: Office chairs installed with pressure sensors were provided to a total of 22 office workers (age = 43.4 ± 8.3 years) in Japan. Pressure sensors data were collected during working days and hours (from morning to evening). The participants were asked to answer subjective levels of pain including LBP. Center of pressure (COP) was calculated from the load level, the changes in COP were analyzed by applying the Toeplitz inverse covariance-based clustering (TICC) analysis, COP changes were categorized into several states. Based on the states, common motifs were identified as a recurring sitting behavior pattern combination of different states by motif-aware state assignment (MASA). Finally, the identified motif was tested as a feature to infer the changing levels of LBP within a day. Changes in the levels of LBP from morning to evening were categorized as exacerbated, did not change, or improved based on the survey questions. Here, we present a novel approach based on social spider algorithm (SSA) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) for the prediction of LBP. The specificity and sensitivity of the LBP inference were compared among ten different models, including SSA-PNN. Result: There exists a common motif, consisting of stable sitting and slight sway. When LBP level improved toward the evening, the frequency of motif appearance was higher than when LBP was exacerbated (p < 0.05) or the level did not change. The performance of the SSA-PNN optimization was better than that of the other algorithms. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were 59.20, 72.46, 40.94, and 63.24%, respectively. Conclusion: A lower frequency of a common motif of the COP dynamic changes characterized by stable sitting and slight sway was found to be associated with the exacerbation of LBP in the evening. LBP exacerbation is predictable by AI-based analysis of COP changes during the sitting behavior of the office workers. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Sato, Nawrin, Widatalla, Kimura and Nagatomi.},

	abstract = {Background: When a virus that has grown in a nonhuman host starts an epidemic in the human population, human cells may not provide growth conditions ideal for the virus. Therefore, the invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is usually prevalent in the bat population, into the human population is thought to have necessitated changes in the viral genome for efficient growth in the new environment. In the present study, to understand host-dependent changes in coronavirus genomes, we focused on the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and investigated how these compositions changed time-dependently in the human cellular environment. We also compared the oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats to investigate the causes of changes in the host environment. Results: Time-series analyses of changes in the nucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a group of mono- and oligonucleotides whose compositions changed in a common direction for all clades, even though viruses belonging to different clades should evolve independently. Interestingly, the compositions of these oligonucleotides changed towards those of coronaviruses that have been prevalent in humans for a long period and away from those of bat coronaviruses. Conclusions: Clade-independent, time-dependent changes are thought to have biological significance and should relate to viral adaptation to a new host environment, providing important clues for understanding viral host adaptation mechanisms. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Time series analysis is becoming more popular in both research and industry. One recent innovation is the Ostinato algorithm, which finds the best preserved patterns that are repeated in a collection of series, i.e. consensus motifs and corresponding radii. However, Ostinato only works as a batch algorithm, can only find the top-k patterns, only finds patterns that are repeated in multiple series and has a runtime that depends on the input series and setup parameters. To tackle these limitations, we present two algorithms in this paper that can answer broader questions. First, we created an anytime version of Ostinato, called Anytime Ostinato, that finds the exact consensus radius for each subsequence, i.e. the radius profile, or can estimate these radii in a fraction of the time. Second, we designed a batch algorithm, called Single Series Ostinato, that finds the radius profile for a single series allowing us to detect repeating patterns in a single series, which is not possible for Ostinato. In this paper we explain both algorithms and apply them to the REFIT and PAMAP2 datasets respectively. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nuclear movements during meiotic prophase, driven by cytoskeleton forces, are a broadly conserved mechanism in opisthokonts and plants to promote pairing between homologous chromosomes. These forces are transmitted to the chromosomes by specific associations between telomeres and the nuclear envelope during meiotic prophase. Defective chromosome movements (CMs) harm pairing and recombination dynamics between homologues, thereby affecting faithful gametogenesis. For this reason, modelling the behaviour of CMs and their possible microvariations as a result of mutations or physico-chemical stress is important to understand this crucial stage of meiosis. Current developments in high-throughput imaging and image processing are yielding large CM datasets that are suitable for data mining approaches. To facilitate adoption of data mining pipelines, we present ChroMo, an interactive, unsupervised cloud application specifically designed for exploring CM datasets from live imaging. ChroMo contains a wide selection of algorithms and visualizations for time-series segmentation, motif discovery, and assessment of causality networks. Using ChroMo to analyse meiotic CMs in fission yeast, we found previously undiscovered features of CMs and causality relationships between chromosome morphology and trajectory.

	abstract = {Time series motif discovery is an important primitive for the time series data mining. With the explosion of new sensing technology, there is a continuously increasing amount of time series data in every aspect of our lives, from seismology, entomology, human activity monitoring, medicine and so on. Considering the rich information included in time series, motif discovery has become an essential part of many data mining tasks. In recent years, the problem of consensus motif discovery in multiple time series begins to appear in our vision. For this task, the existing approaches can only search the consensus motif of a fixed length. However, variable-length motif mining is more common in real applications. To address this problem, the brute force version of the existing fixed-length approach is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient, scalable and exact algorithm VACOMI to search the consensus motif of all lengths in a given motif length range. We evaluate the performance of VACOMI on four real datasets. The results show that VACOMI can reduce up to 96% of the running time compared with the state-of-the-art approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Time series motifs have become a fundamental tool to characterize repeated and conserved structures in systems, such as manufacturing, human behavior and economic activities. Recently the notion of semantic motif was introduced as a generalization of motifs that allows the capture of higher-level semantic structure. Sematic motifs are a very promising primitive; however, the original work characterizes a semantic motif with only two sub-patterns separated by a variable length don't-care region, so it may fail to capture certain types of regularities embedded in a time series. To mitigate this weakness, we propose an adaptive, symbolic and spike-based approximation that allows overlapping segmentation, which we call spikelet. The adaptive and overlapping nature of our representation is more expressive, enabling it to capture both global and local characteristics of a conserved structure. Furthermore, the symbolic nature of our proposed representation enables us to reason about the 'grammatical' structure of the data. With extensive empirical work, we show that spikelet-based algorithms are scalable enough for real-world datasets and enables us to find the higher-level structure that would otherwise escape our attention.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Motif and discord discovery algorithms, which offer effective solutions to identify repeatedly appearing and abnormal patterns, respectively, are fundamental building blocks for time series processing. Both approaches, however, can be time extremely consuming when handling large time series due to the subsequence-based computations of distance similarity metrics. In this article, we show that the highly involved subsequence-based computations can actually be decomposed into a few fine-grained computing patterns for efficient data parallel computing. By developing highly efficient GPU algorithms for such basic patterns and effectively composing such patterns, we are able to solve both motif and discord discovery problems under euclidean and DTW distance metrics in a unified GPU acceleration framework. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed framework outperforms pruned CPU algorithms by up to three orders of magnitude.

Unfortunately, systematic comparisons of causal inference techniques have tended to concentrate on small motifs rather than graphs which it would be natural to label as complex networks. In this paper, six widely used methods of causal network reconstruction are systematically benchmarked and contrasted using neuronal models coupled on networks of varied size. Our purpose is concisely to review and explain the basic problems of causality detection using time series, and to compare the performance of varied and practical methods under the extremely relevant, but relatively neglected, conditions of highly nonlinear dynamical systems coupled via networks of many nodes. We find that convergent cross mapping consistently provides the highest precision, but transfer entropy can be preferable when high recall is important. The advantages of convergent cross mapping and transfer entropy over other methods can increase with network size.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

In this study, we propose a novel method referred to time irreversibility using visibility motifs (TIVM) for quantifying temporal asymmetry by extracting visible and non-visible horizontal visibility graph (HVG) motifs from a time series. The method can be applied using two simple approaches for transforming original time series into visible and non-visible motifs without mapping the time series into complex networks. Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is used to quantify the temporal asymmetry between visible and non-visible HVG motifs of a time series. First, we explore the structural relation between HVG motifs and ordinal patterns reveal that motifs with different structures can have the similar visibility level. Next, we apply the method to find the asymmetry in different synthetic signals and real world interbeat interval (IBI) time series from healthy and pathological subjects. The findings reveal that the proposed method provide more accurate information about the healthy biological systems and changes occurring due to aging or disease. It is an effective tool for discriminating healthy young, elderly and pathological groups. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, it is vital to understand the effects that can emerge from non-linear interaction between oscillations. Here, we show how oscillations typically arise in biology and take the reader on a tour through the great variety in dynamics that can emerge even from a single pair of coupled oscillators.

In parallel, there has been an increased understanding that Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is the best time series similarity measure in a host of settings. Surprisingly however, there has been virtually no work on using DTW to discover motifs. The most obvious explanation of this is the fact that both motif discovery and the use of DTW can be computationally challenging, and the current best mechanisms to address their lethargy are mutually incompatible. In this work, we present the first scalable exact method to discover time series motifs under DTW. Our method automatically performs the best trade-off between time-to-compute and tightness-of-lower-bounds for a novel hierarchy of lower bounds representation we introduce.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to study the characteristics and evolution rules of tagging knowledge network for users with different activity levels in question-and-answer (Q&A) community represented by Zhihu. Design/methodology/approach: A random sample of issue tag data generated by topics in the Zhihu network environment is selected. By defining user quality and selecting the top 20% and bottom 20% of users to focus on, i.e. top users and bot users, the authors apply time slicing for both types of data to construct label knowledge networks, use Q-Q diagrams and ARIMA models to analyze network indicators and introduce the theory and methods of network motif. Findings: This study shows that when the power index of degree distribution is less than or equal to 3.1, the ARIMA model with rank index of label network has a higher fitting degree. With the development of the community, the correlation between tags in the tagging knowledge network is very weak. Research limitations/implications: It is not comprehensive and sufficient to classify users only according to their activity levels. And traditional statistical analysis is not applicable to large data sets. In the follow-up work, the authors will further explore the characteristics of the network at a larger scale and longer timescale and consider adding more node features, including some edge features. Then, users are statistically classified according to the attributes of nodes and edges to construct complex networks, and algorithms such as machine learning and deep learning are used to calculate large-scale data sets to deeply study the evolution of knowledge networks. Practical implications: This paper uses the real data of the Zhihu community to divide users according to user activity and combines the theoretical methods of statistical testing, time series and network motifs to carry out the time series evolution of the knowledge network of the Q&A community. And these research methods provide other network problems with some new ideas. Research has found that user activity has a certain impact on the evolution of the tagging network. The tagging network followed by users with high activity level tends to be stable, and the tagging network followed by users with low activity level gradually fluctuates. Social implications: Research has found that user activity has a certain impact on the evolution of the tagging network. The tagging network followed by users with high activity level tends to be stable, and the tagging network followed by users with low activity level gradually fluctuates. For the community, understanding the formation mechanism of its network structure and key nodes in the network is conducive to improving the knowledge system of the content, finding user behavior preferences and improving user experience. Future research work will focus on identifying outbreak points from a large number of topics, predicting topical trends and conducting timely public opinion guidance and control. Originality/value: In terms of data selection, the user quality is defined; the Zhihu tags are divided into two categories for time slicing; and network indicators and network motifs are compared and analyzed. In addition, statistical tests, time series analysis and network modality theory are used to analyze the tags. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Particularly, fine-gained challenges are handled when we distinguish highly similar species/varieties of rice. To this end, we attempt to construct a large-scale dataset images of ninety rice species. The collected images are normalized in term of both the size and biological structures of a rice seed. We then convert 2-D boundary of a rice seed image as a normalized time series. To find structure and regularities of each species from the collected datasets, we consider the problem of discovering shape-based motifs, which are approximately repeated shapes within (or between) rice species. Distance of a two seeds in each species is calculated using Dynamic Time warping algorithms. The k-level motif is specified by ordering the DTW distances. Two applications of the motif discovery are presented. The first one specify and visually distinguish two similar rice species. This distinguishing suggests valuable features to boot performances of recognition techniques for the rice species classification. The second application presents a visual classification by constructing a similarity map of a large number of rice species.

	abstract = {Graph or network representations are an important foundation for data mining and machine learning tasks in relational data. Many tools of network analysis, like centrality measures, information ranking, or cluster detection rest on the assumption that links capture direct influence, and that paths represent possible indirect influence. This assumption is invalidated in time series data capturing, e.g., time-stamped social interactions, time-resolved co-occurrences or other types of relational time series. In such data, for two time-stamped links (A,B) and (B,C) the chronological ordering and timing determines whether a causal path from node A via B to C exists. A number of works has shown that for this reason network analysis cannot be directly applied to time-stamped data. Existing methods to address this issue require statistics on causal paths, which is computationally challenging for big time series data. Addressing this problem, we develop an efficient algorithm to count causal paths in time-stamped network data. Applying it to empirical data, we show that our method is more efficient than a baseline method implemented in an OpenSource data analytics package. Our method works efficiently for different values of the maximum time difference between consecutive links of a causal path and supports streaming scenarios. With it, we are closing a gap that hinders an efficient analysis of large temporal networks. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {In time series analysis, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) coupled with k Nearest Neighbour classification, where k = 1, is the most commonly used classification model. Even though DTW has a quadratic complexity, it outperforms other similarity measurements in terms of accuracy, hence its popularity. This paper presents two motif-based mechanisms directed at speeding up the DTW process in such a way that accuracy is not adversely affected: (i) the Differential Sub-Sequence Motifs (DSSM) mechanism and (ii) the Matrix Profile Sub-Sequence Motifs (MPSSM) mechanism. Both mechanisms are fully described and evaluated. The evaluation indicates that both DSSM and MPSSM can speed up the DTW process while producing a better, or at least comparable accuracy, in 90% of cases.

Through the design of growth and measurement cycles, Ti K-edge spectral data are continuously recorded so as to characterize the film evolution as a function of ALD cycle number and the surface changes within the time scale of the ALD cycle. A unified set of analysis tools is developed to interpret the time-series of spectral data. A prenucleation stage of growth, a transition region, and then a steady-state growth stage are observed with distinguishable features. Multivariate curve resolution analysis, that is physically constrained, demonstrates two specific spectral components with associated, time-dependent concentrations. The bulk-film component tracks the stages of growth. The surface and interface components, present throughout the stages of growth, reveal a significant coverage of relatively isolated or loosely networked tetrahedrally coordinated Ti atomic motifs. Finally, spectral signatures for the intra-cycle growth kinetics are reconstructed at a time resolution of ∼1 s and demonstrate that the transient Ti motifs on the growing surface stabilize within a few seconds of the Ti precursor pulse.  © },

Surprisingly, it is difficult for large time series datasets. The major difficulty is not time or space complexity, but defining what it means to be representative data for this data type. In this work, we show that the obvious candidate definitions: motifs, shapelets, cluster centers, random samples etc., are all poor choices. We introduce time series snippets, a novel representation of typical time series subsequences. Informally, time series snippets can be seen as the answer to the following question. If a user, which could be a human or a higher-level algorithm, only has resources (including human time) to inspect k subsequences of a long time series, which k subsequences should be chosen? Beyond their utility for visualizing and summarizing massive time series collections, we show that time series snippets have utility for high-level comparison of large time series collections. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A common challenge in multimedia data understanding is the unsupervised discovery of recurring patterns, or motifs, in time series data. The discovery of motifs in uni-variate time series is a well studied problem and, while being a relatively new area of research, there are also several proposals for multi-variate motif discovery. Unfortunately, motif search among multiple variates is an expensive process, as the potential number of sub-spaces in which a pattern can occur increases exponentially with the number of variates. Consequently, many multi-variate motif search algorithms make simplifying assumptions, such as searching for motifs across all variates individually, assuming that the motifs are of the same length, or that they occur on a fixed subset of variates. In this paper, we are interested in addressing a relatively broad form of multi-variate motif detection, which seeks frequently occurring patterns (of possibly differing lengths) in sub-spaces of a multi-variate time series. In particular, we aim to leverage contextual information to help select contextually salient patterns and identify the most frequent patterns among all. Based on these goals, we first introduce the contextually salient multi-variate motif (CS-motif) discovery problem and then propose a salient multi-variate motif (SMM) algorithm that, unlike existing methods, is able to seek a broad range of patterns in multi-variate time series. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Gene expression dynamics, such as stochastic oscillations and aperiodic fluctuations, have been associated with cell fate changes in multiple contexts, including development and cancer. Single cell live imaging of protein expression with endogenous reporters is widely used to observe such gene expression dynamics. However, the experimental investigation of regulatory mechanisms underlying the observed dynamics is challenging, since these mechanisms include complex interactions of multiple processes, including transcription, translation and protein degradation. Here, we present a Bayesian method to infer kinetic parameters of oscillatory gene expression regulation using an auto-negative feedback motif with delay. Specifically, we use a delay-adapted nonlinear Kalman filter within a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm to identify posterior probability distributions. Our method can be applied to time-series data on gene expression from single cells and is able to infer multiple parameters simultaneously. We apply it to published data on murine neural progenitor cells and show that it outperforms alternative methods. We further analyse how parameter uncertainty depends on the duration and time resolution of an imaging experiment, to make experimental design recommendations. This work demonstrates the utility of parameter inference on time course data from single cells and enables new studies on cell fate changes and population heterogeneity. © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Shapelets, also known as motifs, are time series sequences that have the property of discriminating between time series classes. Lately, shapelets studies have gained a lot of momentum due to their interpretable nature. As opposed to traditional time series classifiers, shapelet-based learners provide a visual representation of the pattern that triggers the classification decision. One of the most challenging issues of shapelet-based classifiers is the generation of a large number of shapelet outputs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that addresses the high numerosity problem of mined shapelets issue by mining the minimal set of discriminative shapelets for time series data. We propose a new shapelet mining learner, 1DCNN, that has the property of learning shapelets of different lengths using a black-box neural network model. 1DCNN optimizes the entire classification schema by learning the shapes of the representative patterns. Our proposed model uses network pruning to sparsify the network and keep only the most discriminative shapelets without compromising the classification accuracy. We validated our model using 59 real-world time series datasets from the UCR repository. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in comparison with other competing baselines models. For fairness purposes, we did not compare 1DCNN with ensemble based approaches that encapsulates many learners. Our results show that the performance of our model is superior to all other baselines pertaining to the shapelet-based classifier category, with up to 95% less Floating Points Operations per Second (FLOPs) required by the network. © 2020 IEEE.},

Most motif discovery methods are generally based on support and similarity. Among them, similarity-based Matrix Profile has been adopted in domains recently. However, it generally requires defining motif length in advance, which greatly harms its applicable scenarios. Moreover, unequal lengths of subsequences can be regarded as an informative feature for mining. In this paper, we propose a Sliding Window-based Motif Discovery algorithm (SWMD), which adopts a variable-size sliding window to accurately locate motifs by detecting targets in the generated distance matrix. To achieve higher efficiency, a novel pruning strategy is proposed, where its optimal parameters are achieved through a sensitivity test. Since the proposed algorithm is fit in processing multiple dimensional data, we apply it to discover motifs from a typical and natural spatial-temporal dataset, i.e., flood. Comparative studies with three methods show that the proposed algorithm could find more meaningful motifs within an acceptable time expense.  © 2021 IEEE.},

This measure is based on the idea of matching distributions that only overlap over a portion of their region of support. Our proposed measure is inspired by MPdist which has been previously proposed for such datasets and is constructed using Euclidean metrics, whereas kdiff is constructed using non-linear kernel distances. Also, kdiff accounts for both self and cross similarities across the instances and is defined using a lower quantile of the distance distribution. Comparing the cross similarity to self similarity allows for measures of similarity that are more robust to noise and partial occlusions of the relevant signals. Our proposed measure kdiff is a more general form of the well known kernel-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance estimated over the embeddings. Some theoretical results are provided for separability conditions using kdiff as a distance measure for clustering and classification problems where the embedding distributions can be modeled as two component mixtures. Applications are demonstrated for clustering of synthetic and real-life time series and image data, and the performance of kdiff is compared to competing distance measures for clustering.

These and related problems have effectively been solved for offline analysis of time series; however, these approaches are computationally intensive and do not lend themselves to streaming time series, where the sampling rate imposes real-time constraints on computation and there is strong desire to locate computation as close as possible to the sensor. One promising solution is to use low-cost machine learning models to provide approximate answers to these problems. For example, prior work has trained models to predict the similarity of the most recently sampled window of data points to a representative time series used for training. This work addresses a more challenging problem: to predict not only the "strength"of the match, but also the relative location in the representative time series where the match occurs. We evaluate our approach on two different real world datasets; we demonstrate speedups as high as 40× compared to exact computations, with predictive accuracy as high as 87.9%, depending on the granularity of the prediction. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Time series motifs have become a fundamental tool to characterize repeated and conserved structure in systems, such as manufacturing telemetry, economic activities, and both human physiological and cultural behaviors. Recently time series chains were introduced as a generalization of time series motifs to represent evolving patterns in time series, in order to characterize the evolution of systems. Time series chains are a very promising primitive; however, we have observed that the original definition can be brittle in the sense that a small fluctuation in time series may "cut" a chain. Furthermore, the original definition does not provide a measure of the "significance" of a chain, and therefore cannot support top-k search for chains or provide a mechanism to discard spurious chains that might be discovered when searching large datasets. Inspired by observations from dynamical systems theory, this paper introduces two novel quality metrics for time series chains, directionality and graduality, to improve robustness and to enable top-K search. With extensive empirical work we show that our proposed definition is much more robust to the vagaries of real-word datasets and allows us to find unexpected regularities in time series datasets. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {The nonsinusoidal waveform is emerging as an important feature of neuronal oscillations. However, the role of single-cycle shape dynamics in rapidly unfolding brain activity remains unclear. Here, we develop an analytical framework that isolates oscillatory signals from time series using masked empirical mode decomposition to quantify dynamical changes in the shape of individual cycles (along with amplitude, frequency, and phase) with instantaneous frequency. We show how phase-alignment, a process of projecting cycles into a regularly sampled phase grid space, makes it possible to compare cycles of different durations and shapes. "Normalized shapes"can then be constructed with high temporal detail while accounting for differences in both duration and amplitude. We find that the instantaneous frequency tracks nonsinusoidal shapes in both simulated and real data. Notably, in local field potential recordings of mouse hippocampal CA1, we find that theta oscillations have a stereotyped slow-descending slope in the cycle-wise average yet exhibit high variability on a cycle-by-cycle basis. We show how principal component analysis allows identification of motifs of theta cycle waveform that have distinct associations to cycle amplitude, cycle duration, and animal movement speed. By allowing investigation into oscillation shape at high temporal resolution, this analytical framework will open new lines of inquiry into how neuronal oscillations support moment-by-moment information processing and integration in brain networks.

	abstract = {With the exception of a few master transcription factors, regulators of neutrophil maturation are poorly annotated in the intermediate phenotypes between the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) and the mature neutrophil phenotype. Additional challenges in identifying gene expression regulators in differentiation pathways relate to challenges wherein starting cell populations are heterogeneous in lineage potential and development, are spread across various states of quiescence, as well as sample quality and input limitations. These factors contribute to data variability make it difficult to draw simple regulatory inferences. In response we have applied a multi-omics approach using primary blood progenitor cells primed for homogeneous proliferation and granulocyte differentiation states which combines whole transcriptome resequencing (Ampliseq RNA) supported by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) validation and mass spectrometry-based proteomics in a hypothesis-generation study of neutrophil differentiation pathways. Primary CD34+ cells isolated from human cord blood were first precultured in non-lineage driving medium to achieve an active, proliferating phenotype from which a neutrophil primed progenitor was isolated and cultured in neutrophil lineage supportive medium. Samples were then taken at 24-hour intervals over 9 days and analysed by Ampliseq RNA and mass spectrometry. The Ampliseq dataset depth, breadth and quality allowed for several unexplored transcriptional regulators and ncRNAs to be identified using a combinatorial approach of hierarchical clustering, enriched transcription factor binding motifs, and network mapping. Network mapping in particular increased comprehension of neutrophil differentiation regulatory relationships by implicating ARNT, NHLH1, PLAG1, and 6 non-coding RNAs associated with PU.1 regulation as cell-engineering targets with the potential to increase total neutrophil culture output. Overall, this study develops and demonstrates an effective new hypothesis generation methodology for transcriptome profiling during differentiation, thereby enabling identification of novel gene targets for editing interventions. © 2021 Schwaber et al.

	abstract = {Time series data remains a perennially important datatype considered in data mining. In the last decade there has been an increasing realization that time series data can best understood by reasoning about time series subsequences on the basis of their similarity to other subsequences: the two most familiar such time series concepts being motifs and discords. Time series motifs refer to two particularly close subsequences, whereas time series discords indicate subsequences that are far from their nearest neighbors. However, we argue that it can sometimes be useful to simultaneously reason about a subsequence's closeness to certain data and its distance to other data. In this work we introduce a novel primitive called the Contrast Profile that allows us to efficiently compute such a definition in a principled way. As we will show, the Contrast Profile has many downstream uses, including anomaly detection, data exploration, and preprocessing unstructured data for classification.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Understanding how animal movements change across space and time is a fundamental question in ecology. While classical analyses of trajectories give insightful descriptors of spatial patterns, a satisfying method for assessing the temporal succession of such patterns is lacking. Network analyses are increasingly used to capture properties of complex animal trajectories in simple graphical metrics. Here, building on this approach, we introduce a method that incorporates time into movement network analyses based on temporal sequences of network motifs. We illustrate our method using four example trajectories (bumblebee, black kite, roe deer, wolf) collected with different technologies (harmonic radar, platform terminal transmitter, global positioning system). First, we transformed each trajectory into a spatial network by defining the animal's coordinates as nodes and movements in between as edges. Second, we extracted temporal sequences of network motifs from each movement network and compared the resulting behavioural profiles to topological features of the original trajectory. Finally, we compared each sequence of motifs with simulated Brownian and Lévy random motions to statistically determine differences between trajectories and classical movement models. Our analysis of the temporal sequences of network motifs in individual movement networks revealed successions of spatial patterns corresponding to changes in behavioural modes that can be attributed to specific spatio-temporal events of each animal trajectory. Future applications of our method to multi-layered movement and social network analysis yield considerable promises for extending the study of complex movement patterns at the population level. © 2020 British Ecological Society},

Based on only limited knowledge about the appliance operating characteristics, the unsupervised NILM can autonomously extract load characteristic samples of appliances in unseen scenario, such as power waveform samples, and then form a personalized load signature base. Usually, the power consumption patterns and corresponding power waveform samples of the same appliance will appear repeatedly in the load power data according to users' appliance usage habits, therefore, the load characteristic sample can be extracted by searching for recurring subsequences in the load power time series, which is the core of unsupervised NILM. Motif discovery can discover similar subsequences with fixed or variable length in the time series of a large amount of data. In this research, we use motif discovery method to mine appliance power consumption patterns for the first time, and explore the possibility of the application of motif discovery in unsupervised NILM, to deal with the multiple time-scale characteristics of appliance power consumption patterns more effectively.

Many motif discovery techniques were introduced and applied in various domains like E-commerce, Weather Prediction, Seismology, etc. In this paper, we introduce a technique for anomaly detection and motif discovery in the ECG data using Matrix Profile which has been introduced recently in the literature. Anomaly detection in ECG helps to detect the abnormal heartbeats before the process of diagnosis and motif discovery helps to locate the highly similar beats in the ECG. Using Matrix Profile for the task of anomaly detection and motif discovery in our proposed technique provides our technique with properties that are inherited from Matrix Profile.

	abstract = {The proliferation of wearable sensors allows for the continuous collection of temporal characterization of an individual’s physical activity and physiological data. This is enabling an unprecedented opportunity to delve into a deeper analysis of the underlying patterns of such temporal data and to infer attributes associated with health, behaviors, and well-being. However, there remain several challenges to fully discover both structural and temporal patterns (motifs) in these data streams and to leverage the semantic relationship among these motifs. These include: i) the temporal data of variable length and high resolution leads to the motifs of various sizes; ii) periodic occurrences and hierarchical overlaps of these motifs further challenge the modeling of their complex structural and semantic relations. We propose a semantic-aware unsupervised representation learning model, motif2vec, to learn the latent representation of time series data collected from wearable sensors. The motif2vec consists of three major components: 1) transforming the time series into a set of variable-length motif sequences; 2) formalizing random walks to construct the neighborhood of motifs and thus to extract structural and semantic relationship among motifs; 3) learning time series latent features to capture the motif neighborhood structure with a skip-gram model. Experiments on two real-world datasets, derived from two different wearables and population groups, show motif2vec outperforms six state-of-the-art benchmarks on various tasks. © 2021 IEEE.},

Even though many papers have addressed the problem of how to find motifs in time-series by proposing new motif discovery algorithms, not much work has been done on the exploration of the motifs extracted by these algorithms. In this paper, we argue that visually exploring time-series motifs computed by motif discovery algorithms can be useful to understand and debug results.To explore the output of motif discovery algorithms, we propose the use of an adapted Self-Organizing Map, the DTW-SOM, on the list of motif's centers. In short, DTW-SOM is a vanilla Self-Organizing Map with three main differences, namely (1) the use the Dynamic Time Warping distance instead of the Euclidean distance, (2) the adoption of two new network initialization routines (a random sample initialization and an anchor initialization) and (3) the adjustment of the Adaptation phase of the training to work with variable-length time-series sequences.We test DTW-SOM in a synthetic motif dataset and two real time-series datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive [1]. After an exploration of results, we conclude that DTW-SOM is capable of extracting relevant information from a set of motifs and display it in a visualization that is space-efficient. © 2020 IEEE.},

Supervisory control and data acquisition system provides alarm activations in case of failure, and also signals of the system. Due to the volume and different type of data, these systems require advanced analytics to ensure a suitable maintenance management. Several methods are employed, mainly based in artificial intelligence that involve advanced trainings and elevated computational costs with high possibilities to detect false positives. The novelty proposed in this work is based on motif analysis using an Internet of the Things platform to analyze large time series data for wind turbine monitoring. It is presented an approach considering personalized motifs in specific periods of the signal dataset with more influence in the alarm activation.

	abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) and their complex interplay are essential for directing specific genetic programs, such as responses to environmental stresses, tissue development, or cell differentiation by regulating gene expression. Knowledge regarding TF–TF cooperations could be promising in gaining insight into the developmental switches between the cultivars of Brassica napus L., namely Zhongshuang11 (ZS11), a double-low accession with high-oil-content, and Zhongyou821 (ZY821), a double-high accession with low-oil-content. In this regard, we analysed a time series RNA-seq data set of seed tissue from both of the cultivars by mainly focusing on the monotonically expressed genes (MEGs). The consideration of the MEGs enables the capturing of multi-stage progression processes that are orchestrated by the cooperative TFs and, thus, facilitates the understanding of the molecular mechanisms determining seed oil content. Our findings show that TF families, such as NAC, MYB, DOF, GATA, and HD-ZIP are highly involved in the seed developmental process. Particularly, their preferential partner choices as well as changes in their gene expression profiles seem to be strongly associated with the differentiation of the oil content between the two cultivars. These findings are essential in enhancing our understanding of the genetic programs in both cultivars and developing novel hypotheses for further experimental studies. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {System of Systems (SoS) based on service composition is considered as an effective way to build large-scale complex software systems. It regards the system as a service and integrates multiple component systems into a new system. The performance of the component system may fluctuate at any time because of the complex and changeable running state and external environment of the component system, which will affect the running of the SoS. The online reliability prediction technology is used to predict the reliability of the component system of an SoS in the near future. It aims to find errors and correct them in time so as to ensure that the SoS can run continuously and smoothly. To tackle the reliability prediction problem of component system in a dynamic and uncertain environment, the paper integrates Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) with time series motifs to achieve a new prediction model (m_MEMM), which is referred to as motifs-based MEMM.

The first one stems from calculating the Euclidean distance among the sequences; SAX is a quick form of clustering by approximating the values of a sequence; time topology simply refers to the fact that consecutive sequences are naturally similar. By interweaving these three topologies one can prune the calls to the distance function in respect to the brute force algorithm and thus speed up the calculation of the nnd profile.

Most studies, however, have been conducted in controlled laboratory environments with artificially-induced psychological responses. While this assures that high quality data are collected, the amount of data is limited and the transferability of the findings to more ecologically-appropriate settings (i.e., "in-the-wild") remains unknown. In this paper, we explore the use of motif-based multi-scale HRV features to predict anxiety and stress in-the-wild. To further improve their robustness to artifacts, we propose a quality-aware feature aggregation method. The new quality-aware features are tested on a dataset collected using a wearable biometric sensor from over 200 hospital workers (nurses and staff) during their work shifts. Results show improved stress/anxiety measurement over using conventional time- and frequency-domain HRV measures. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Organogenesis involves dynamic regulation of gene transcription and complex multipathway interactions. Despite our knowledge of key factors regulating various steps of heart morphogenesis, considerable challenges in understanding its mechanism still exist because little is known about their downstream targets and interactive regulatory network. To better understand transcriptional regulatory mechanism driving heart development and the consequences of its disruption in vivo, we performed time-series analyses of the transcriptome and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in isolated cardiomyocytes (CMs) from wild-type zebrafish embryos at developmental stages corresponding to heart tube morphogenesis, looping, and maturation. We identified genetic regulatory modules driving crucial events of heart development that contained key cardiac TFs and are associated with open chromatin regions enriched for DNA sequence motifs belonging to the family of the corresponding TFs. Loss of function of cardiac TFs Gata5, Tbx5a, and Hand2 affected the cardiac regulatory networks and caused global changes in chromatin accessibility profile, indicating their role in heart development. Among regions with differential chromatin accessibility in mutants were highly conserved noncoding elements that represent putative enhancers driving heart development. The most prominent gene expression changes, which correlated with chromatin accessibility modifications within their proximal promoter regions, occurred between heart tube morphogenesis and looping, and were associated with metabolic shift and hematopoietic/cardiac fate switch during CM maturation. Our results revealed the dynamic regulatory landscape throughout heart development and identified interactive molecular networks driving key events of heart morphogenesis. © 2019 Pawlak et al.},

However, to date there are no tools to find repeated structure in sets of time series, an idea we call time series consensus motifs in recognition of their similarity to their discrete analogs in DNA strings. In this work we introduce a definition of time series consensus motifs and a scalable algorithm to discover them in large data collections.

	abstract = {Magnetotactic bacteria are a highly studied group of diverse prokaryotes that biomineralize chains of magnetosomes, single domain, single crystal magnetic nanoparticles of magnetite or greigite, enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane whose synthesis is under strict genetic control. In addition to characterizing the genetics and physicochemical properties of both cultured and uncultured environmental species, there have been a number of investigations using a time course approach to determine the chemical pathway of magnetite biomineralization in these organisms. In time course studies, cells of MTB are typically grown in the absence of iron so they cannot make magnetite, and then provided with iron in culture medium which initiates the biomineralization of magnetosome chains over a subsequent time period. Results from previous time course studies are not consistent with one another, differing with regard to the nature of chemical intermediates and the rate of establishment of magnetosome chains. In this work we report a time course study of Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 over a 48 h (hour) period, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and soft X-ray scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) at the Fe L-edge. STXM provides capability to measure X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) and map chemical species with ∼25 nm spatial resolution and thus gives detailed results on the chemistry of individual particles in single cells. An evolution of the iron oxide speciation, from a more Fe(III)-rich species, possibly α-hematite (Fe2O3), to magnetite (Fe3O4), was observed in the early stages, with evidence for the presence of the Fe(III)-rich character persisting up to 24 h. The spectromicroscopy (X-ray absorption, XAS and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, XMCD) and TEM results show that biomineralization occurs in a stepwise fashion. First, very small particles, with no measurable magnetization, are produced at different sites in the cell without significant chain formation. The Fe L3 spectra of these early stage particles typically differ from magnetite with an additional signal at 708.4 eV that is consistent with α-hematite. By 6–8 h the particles are more numerous, partial chain formation is evident, and the L3 spectrum is very similar to that of magnetite. By 24 h particles-in-chains are the dominant motif and magnetism with the moment along the chain is established. By 48 h the cells are essentially the same as cells grown in Fe-rich medium. © 2019 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Parametrised state space models in the form of recurrent networks are often used in machine learning to learn from data streams exhibiting temporal dependencies. To break the black box nature of such models it is important to understand the dynamical features of the input-driving time series that are formed in the state space. We propose a framework for rigorous analysis of such state representations in vanishing memory state space models such as echo state networks (ESN). In particular, we consider the state space a temporal feature space and the readout mapping from the state space a kernel machine operating in that feature space. We show that: (1) The usual ESN strategy of randomly generating input-to-state, as well as state coupling leads to shallow memory time series representations, corresponding to cross-correlation operator with fast exponentially decaying coefficients; (2) Imposing symmetry on dynamic coupling yields a constrained dynamic kernel matching the input time series with straightforward exponentially decaying motifs or exponentially decaying motifs of the highest frequency; (3) Simple ring (cycle) high-dimensional reservoir topology specified only through two free parameters can implement deep memory dynamic kernels with a rich variety of matching motifs. We quantify richness of feature representations imposed by dynamic kernels and demonstrate that for dynamic kernel associated with cycle reservoir topology, the kernel richness undergoes a phase transition close to the edge of stability. © 2020 Peter Tino.

	abstract = {As companies are increasingly measuring their products and services, the amount of time series data is rising and techniques to extract usable information are needed. One recently developed data mining technique for time series is the Matrix Profile. It consists of the smallest z-normalized Euclidean distance of each subsequence of a time series to all other subsequences of another series. It has been used for motif and discord discovery, for segmentation and as building block for other techniques. One side effect of the z-normalization used is that small fluctuations on flat signals are upscaled. This can lead to high and unintuitive distances for very similar subsequences from noisy data. We determined an analytic method to estimate and remove the effects of this noise, adding only a single, intuitive parameter to the calculation of the Matrix Profile. This paper explains our method and demonstrates it by performing discord discovery on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark and by segmenting the PAMAP2 activity dataset. We find that our technique results in a more intuitive Matrix Profile and provides improved results in both usecases for series containing many flat, noisy subsequences. Since our technique is an extension of the Matrix Profile, it can be applied to any of the various tasks that could be solved by it, improving results where data contains flat and noisy sequences.

	abstract = {Companies are increasingly measuring their products and services, resulting in a rising amount of available time series data, making techniques to extract usable information needed. One state-of-the-art technique for time series is the Matrix Profile, which has been used for various applications including motif/discord discovery, visualizations and semantic segmentation. Internally, the Matrix Profile utilizes the z-normalized Euclidean distance to compare the shape of subsequences between two series. However, when comparing subsequences that are relatively flat and contain noise, the resulting distance is high despite the visual similarity of these subsequences. This property violates some of the assumptions made by Matrix Profile based techniques, resulting in worse performance when series contain flat and noisy subsequences. By studying the properties of the z-normalized Euclidean distance, we derived a method to eliminate this effect requiring only an estimate of the standard deviation of the noise. In this paper we describe various practical properties of the z-normalized Euclidean distance and show how these can be used to correct the performance of Matrix Profile related techniques. We demonstrate our techniques using anomaly detection using a Yahoo! Webscope anomaly dataset, semantic segmentation on the PAMAP2 activity dataset and for data visualization on a UCI activity dataset, all containing real-world data, and obtain overall better results after applying our technique. Our technique is a straightforward extension of the distance calculation in the Matrix Profile and will benefit any derived technique dealing with time series containing flat and noisy subsequences. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this paper, we propose an efficient approximate algorithm, called DiscMotifs, to discover the K most significant (KMS) motifs from time series. First, the proposed algorithm transforms the time series into a SAX representation and then the algorithm divides the SAX representation into subsequences. Next, these subsequences are linearized by projecting them into a one-dimensional space based on their distances form a randomly selected reference point, or a subsequence. By utilizing the linear ordering of subsequences, DiscMotifs efficiently discovers the KMS motifs. DiscMotifs algorithm requires a storage space linear to the number of subsequences. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on several synthetic and real application datasets. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Human tankyrase-1 (TNKS) is a member of the poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) superfamily of proteins that posttranslationally modify themselves and target proteins with ADP-ribose (termed PARylation). The TNKS ankyrin repeat domain mediates interactions with a growing number of structurally and functionally diverse binding partners, linking TNKS activity to multiple critical cell processes, including Wnt signaling, Golgi trafficking, and telomere maintenance. However, some binding partners can engage TNKS without being modified, suggesting that separate parameters influence TNKS interaction and PARylation. Here, we present an analysis of the sequence and structural features governing TNKS interactions with two model binding partners: The PARylated partner telomeric repeat-binding factor 1 (TRF1) and the non-PARylated partner GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD). Using a combination of TNKS-binding assays, PARP activity assays, and analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation analysis, we found that both the specific sequence of a given TNKS-binding peptide motif and the quaternary structure of individual binding partners play important roles in TNKS interactions. We demonstrate that GMD forms stable 1:1 complexes with the TNKS ankyrin repeat domain; yet, consistent with results from previous studies, we were unable to detect GMD modification. We also report in vitro evidence that TNKS primarily directs PAR modification to glutamate/aspartate residues. Our results suggest that TNKS-binding partners possess unique sequence and structural features that control binding and PARylation. Ultimately, our findings highlight the binding partner:ankyrin repeat domain interface as a viable target for inhibition ofTNKS activity. © 2019 Eisemann et al.},

	abstract = {The gastric pathogen and carcinogen Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) encodes a type IV secretion system for translocation of the effector protein CagA into host cells. Injected CagA becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated at the five amino acid residue Glutamate-Proline- IsoleucineTyrosine-Alanine (EPIYA)-sequence motifs. These phosphorylated EPIYA-sites represent recognition motifs for binding of multiple host factors, which then manipulate signaling pathways to trigger gastric disease. Thus, efficient detection of single phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs in CagA is required. Detection of phospho-CagA is primarily performed using commercial panphosphotyrosine antibodies. However, those antibodies were originally generated to recognize many phosphotyrosines in various mammalian proteins and are not optimized for use in bacteria. To address this important limitation, we synthesized 11-mer phospho- and non-phospho-peptides from EPIYA-motifs A, B, and C, and produced three phospho-specific and three non-phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal CagA antibodies. These antibodies specifically recognized the corresponding phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs, while the EPIYA-C antibodies also recognized the related East-Asian EPIYA-D motif. Otherwise, no cross-reactivity of the antibodies among EPIYAs was observed. Western blotting demonstrated that each EPIYA-motif can be predominantly phosphorylated during H. pylori infection. This represents the first complete set of phospho-specific antibodies for an effector protein in bacteria, providing useful tools to gather information for the categorization of CagA phosphorylation, cancer signaling, and gastric disease progression. © 2019 by the authors.},

However, when it comes to spatial-time series, a clear gap can be observed according to the literature review. This paper tackles such a gap by presenting an approach to discover and rank motifs in spatial-time series, denominated Combined Series Approach (CSA). CSA is based on partitioning the spatial-time series into blocks. Inside each block, subsequences of spatial-time series are combined in a way that hash-based motif discovery algorithm is applied. Motifs are validated according to both temporal and spatial constraints. Later, motifs are ranked according to their entropy, the number of occurrences, and the proximity of their occurrences. The approach was evaluated using both synthetic and seismic datasets. CSA outperforms traditional methods designed only for time series. CSA was also able to prioritize motifs that were meaningful both in the context of synthetic data and also according to seismic specialists.  © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

In this work, we introduce a time series processing pipeline to summarize an optimal set of variable-length motifs in a real-world wearable recording data-set collected in a hospital workplace setting. We propose the use of the Savitzky-Golay filter for noise removal without significant data distortion. We then combine the previously developed HierarchIcal based Motif Enumeration (HIME) algorithm with a principled optimization approach to obtain the most repetitive patterns in long-term wearable time-series. We also describe challenges in using just a single method to detect motifs in wearable time series in our experiments. We demonstrate our pipeline can effectively identify meaningful variable-length motifs in large-scale heart rate signals collected continuously from over 100 individuals both at and outside their workplace over 10 weeks through two machine learning experiments. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Permutation Entropy (PE) has been widely applied as a non-linear statistical indicator to estimate the change of complexity in time series. Though it is conceptually simple and computationally fast, PE encounters a few limitations. For example, the amplitude differences in time series are neglected, and the symbolic sequences generated from equal values are according to their emergence order. In this paper, an Edge Permutation Entropy (EdgePE) measure is proposed to improve the performance of PE, mainly overcoming its lack of ability to differentiate between amplitude differences in motifs that correspond to the same order pattern. The advantage of EdgePE relies on that amplitude change information can be identified and distinguished by the information underlying in the 'edge' distance between data points in the reconstructed embedded vectors. To demonstrate its improvement, the proposed EdgePE is compared with other related improved PE approaches, for analyzing synthetic time series and experimental rolling bearing data sets, respectively. The results indicate that the EdgePE can effectively characterize amplitude changes in time series (e.g., for spike and stuck detection) and improve the accuracy of pattern recognition for rolling bearing fault diagnosis, compared to those of the other related PE measures. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Despite its widely demonstrated usefulness, there is still room for improvement in the basic Permutation Entropy (PE) algorithm, as several subsequent studies have proposed in the recent years. For example, some improved PE variants try to address possible PE weaknesses, such as its only focus on ordinal information, and not on amplitude, or the possible detrimental impact of equal values in subsequences due to motif ambiguity. Other evolved PE methods try to reduce the influence of input parameters. A good representative of this last point is the Bubble Entropy (BE) method. BE is based on sorting relations instead of ordinal patterns, and its promising capabilities have not been extensively assessed yet. The objective of the present study was to comparatively assess the classification performance of this new method, and study and exploit the possible synergies between PE and BE. The claimed superior performance of BE over PE was first evaluated by conducting a series of time series classification tests over a varied and diverse experimental set. The results of this assessment apparently suggested that there is a complementary relationship between PE and BE, instead of a superior/inferior relationship. A second set of experiments using PE and BE simultaneously as the input features of a clustering algorithm, demonstrated that with a proper algorithm configuration, classification accuracy and robustness can benefit from both measures. © 2020 the author(s).},

	abstract = {The energy use of many buildings is significantly influenced by the presence and number of occupants. The prevalence of personal mobile devices has highlighted Wi-Fi data as a strong indicator of occupancy levels, with a strong correlation between the number of occupants and the number of Wi-Fienabled devices in a building. With accurate occupancy-count estimations, occupancy-based controls for building HVAC systems have the potential to realize energy savings. However, reactive controls based on instantaneous occupancy-count estimates are not sufficient for optimal operation. Instead, characterizing occupancy patterns can allow building operators to make proactive and informed decisions about equipment schedules, which has the potential to reduce energy use. This paper presents a Wi-Fi based approach for occupancy pattern detection, using an academic office building as a case study. Occupancy in many buildings - including the case study building - is not entirely stochastic; a visual inspection of Wi-Fi time series data will reveal repetitious patterns throughout the year, such as several distinct weekday and weekend profiles, called motifs. Seven months of continuous Wi-Fi time series data is processed through an occupancy-count estimation function to develop predicted occupancy profiles for each day. These occupancy profiles are clustered using several different approaches, including hierarchical agglomerative clustering with different dissimilarity metrics and k-means clustering. The results and performance indices for different clustering techniques are discussed. Based on this analysis, typical cluster profiles are extracted. Each typical profile is quantized using alphabetic characters and a character is assigned to each day. These characters are combined into corresponding words for each week. Frequently repeated weekly words are identified, and rule extraction is performed using a classification tree to develop a day-ahead occupancy forecast. The results show that this methodology can be used on Wi-Fi data to generate insights into occupancy patterns in the case study building. The forecastingframework can also be used to accurately forecast occupancy over the 24-hour prediction horizon. Future work will implement a control scheme based on the results from this study in a real-world air handling unit to quantify energy savings. © 2019 ASHRAE.},

	abstract = {Monitoring the temporal changes in the operational states of appliances is a key step in inferring the dynamics of operations in smart homes. This information could be leveraged in a variety of energy management applications including energy breakdown of individual loads, inferring the occupancy patterns, and associating the energy use to occupants’ activities. The operational states of appliances could be identified through detecting and classifying the events on power time-series. Despite the advancements in the field of event detection, they often require in-situ configuration of model parameters to achieve a higher level of performance according to each new context. In order to address such limitation, in this paper, we have proposed a self-configuring event detection framework for detecting the changes in operational states of appliances. The framework seeks to autonomously learn the contextual characteristics of the loads from the environment and adapt the event detection parameters. The proposed unsupervised framework couples an automated clustering for identifying the recurring motifs, which are representations of the appliances’ transient power draw signatures in a given environment and a proximity-based motif matching for detecting the events. The framework was evaluated on EMBED dataset, a publicly available fully labeled electricity disaggregation dataset, collected from three apartments with different categories of the appliances. The evaluations demonstrate that the proposed event detection framework outperforms the conventional event detection in detecting the operational states of different classes of loads across different environments. The proposed framework could also facilitate human-building interactions in training smart home applications by populating motifs to infer the operations of appliances and activities of occupants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Quantification and parametrisation of movement are widely used in animal behavioural paradigms. In particular, free movement in controlled conditions (e.g., open field paradigm) is used as a “proxy for indices of baseline and drug-induced behavioural changes. However, the analysis of this is often time- and labour-intensive and existing algorithms do not always classify the behaviour correctly. Here, we propose a new approach to quantify behaviour in an unconstrained environment: searching for frequent patterns (k-motifs) in the time series representing the position of the subject over time. Validation of this method was performed using subchronic quinpirole-induced changes in open field experiment behaviours in rodents. Analysis of this data was performed using k-motifs as features to better classify subjects into experimental groups on the basis of behaviour in the open field. Our classifier using k-motifs gives as high as 94% accuracy in classifying repetitive behaviour versus controls which is a substantial improvement compared to currently available methods including using standard feature definitions (depending on the choice of feature set and classification strategy, accuracy up to 88%). Furthermore, visualisation of the movement/time patterns is highly predictive of these behaviours. By using machine learning, this can be applied to behavioural analysis across experimental paradigms. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Side-channel analysis covers several methods for determining the state of a device without directly interacting with the device. In previous work, we collected near-field radio frequency emanations from simple programs to assess how various code operations could be differentiated at the instruction level. However, detecting operations in large blocks of instructions in more complicated programs have proven difficult due to the high dimensionality of the data. In this research, we examine methods to differentiate common operations using RF emanations. We use a series of example codes useful for Two Factor Authentication on an Arduino Mega. Some examples are coded with extra operations to simulate malware such as intentionally leaking the key, nuisance operations, or substituting a weaker hash function. After collecting RF data, approximation techniques are used to reduce the data dimensionality and identify motifs in the time series. The motifs are correlated with the operations taking place by use of a uniquely identifiable triggering mechanism. Several exemplary motifs are then used together as templates that can be used to search for a connected series of operations. These templates are compared with an RF time series of unknown operations using a minimum distance metric. We evaluate the quality of templates available from an RF data collection and examine the usefulness of templates as features for classification. © 2019 SPIE.},

A bottleneck in dealing with such datasets lies in developing effective algorithms for extracting useful information from them. Algorithms for finding patterns in biological data pave the way for extracting crucial information from the voluminous datasets. In this paper, we focus on a fundamental pattern, namely, the closest ll-mers. Given a set of mm biological strings S_1,S_2,\ldots, S_mS1,S2,...,Sm and an integer ll, the problem of interest is that of finding an ll-mer from each string such that the distance among them is the least. For example we want to find mm ll-mers X_1,X_2,\ldots, X_mX1,X2,...,Xm such that X_iXi is an ll-mer in S_iSi (for 1\leq i\leq m1≤i≤m) and the Hamming distance among these mm ll-mers is the least (from among all such possible ll-mers). This problem has many applications. An application of great importance is motif search. Algorithms for finding the closest ll-mers have been used in solving the (l,d)(l,d)-motif search problem (see e.g., [1] , [2] ). In this paper novel exact and approximate algorithms are proposed for this problem for the case of m>2m>2. In particular, a comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed for m=3m=3, along with a further empirical study of m=4m=4 and 5. We also extend our solution to euclidean distance measurement metric if the sequences contain real numbers. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

The regimes analyzed include periodic, chaotic, and hyperchaotic regimes, as well as intermittent regimes and regimes at the edge of chaos. We use the methods of algebraic topology, in particular, simplicial complexes, to define simplicial characterizers, which can analyze the simplicial structure of the networks at both the global and local levels. The simplicial characterizers bring out the hierarchical levels of complexity at various topological levels. These hierarchical levels of complexity find the skeleton of the local dynamics embedded in the network, which influence the global dynamical properties of the system and also permit the identification of dominant motifs. We also analyze the same networks using conventional network characterizers such as average path lengths and clustering coefficients. We see that the simplicial characterizers are capable of distinguishing between different dynamical regimes and can pick up subtle differences in dynamical behavior, whereas the usual characterizers provide a coarser characterization. However, the two taken in conjunction can provide information about the dynamical behavior of the time series, as well as the correlations in the evolving system. Our methods can, therefore, provide powerful tools for the analysis of dynamical systems. © 2020 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Detecting repeating patterns of different lengths in time series, also called variable-length motifs, has received a great amount of attention by researchers and practitioners. Despite the significant progress that has been made in recent single dimensional variable-length motif discovery work, detecting variable-length sub dimensional motifs - patterns that are simultaneously occurring only in a subset of dimensions in multivariate time series - remains a difficult task. The main challenge is scalability. On the one hand, the brute-force enumeration solution, which searches for motifs of all possible lengths, is very time consuming even in single dimensional time series. On the other hand, previous work show that index-based fixed-length approximate motif discovery algorithms such as random projection are not suitable for detecting variable-length motifs due to memory requirement. In this paper, we introduce an approximate variable-length subdimensional motif discovery algorithm called Collaborative HIerarchy based Motif Enumeration (CHIME) to efficiently detect variable-length subdimensional motifs given a minimum motif length in large-scale multivariate time series. We show that the memory cost of the approach is significantly smaller than that of random projection. Moreover, the speed of the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. We demonstrate that CHIME can efficiently detect meaningful variable-length subdimensional motifs in large real world multivariate time series datasets. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many time series analytic tasks can be reduced to discovering and then reasoning about conserved structures, or time series motifs. Recently, the Matrix Profile has emerged as the state-of-the-art for finding time series motifs, allowing the community to efficiently find time series motifs in large datasets. The matrix profile reduced time series motif discovery to a process requiring a single parameter, the length of time series motifs we expect (or wish) to find. In many cases this is a reasonable limitation as the user may utilize out-of-band information or domain knowledge to set this parameter. However, in truly exploratory data mining, a poor choice of this parameter can result in failing to find unexpected and exploitable regularities in the data. In this work, we introduce the Pan Matrix Profile, a new data structure which contains the nearest neighbor information for all subsequences of all lengths. This data structure allows the first truly parameter-free motif discovery algorithm in the literature. The sheer volume of information produced by our representation may be overwhelming; thus, we also introduce a novel visualization tool called the motif-heatmap which allows the users to discover and reason about repeated structures at a glance. We demonstrate our ideas on a diverse set of domains including seismology, bioinformatics, transportation and biology. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Detecting repeated variable-length patterns, also called variable-length motifs, has received a great amount of attention in recent years. The state-of-the-art algorithm utilizes a fixed-length motif discovery algorithm as a subroutine to enumerate variable-length motifs. As a result, it may take hours or days to execute when the enumeration range is large. In this work, we introduce an approximate algorithm called hierarchical-based motif enumeration (HIME) to detect variable-length motifs with a large enumeration range in million-scale time series. We show in the experiments that the scalability of the proposed algorithm is significantly better than that of the state-of-the-art algorithm. Moreover, the motif length range detected by HIME is considerably larger than previous sequence matching-based approximate variable-length motif discovery approach. We demonstrate that HIME can efficiently detect meaningful variable-length motifs in long, real-world time series. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

In this paper, we propose an efficient method for discovering motifs based on suffix array. This method consists of transforming a time series into a symbolic string and then finding repeated substring in the symbolic string based on the suffix array. Besides, we also speed up the execution time of the method by applying multi-core parallelism.

First, it is a very general representation, allowing for the discovery of time series motifs, discords, chains, joins, shapelets, segmentations etc. Secondly, it can be computed very efficiently, allowing for fast exact computation and ultra-fast approximate computation. For analysts that use the Matrix Profile frequently, its incremental computability means that they can perform ad-hoc analytics at any time, with almost no delay time. However, they can only issue global queries. That is, queries that consider all the data from time zero to the current time. This is a significant limitation, as they may be interested in localized questions about a contiguous subset of the data. For example, "do we have any unusual motifs that correspond with that unusually cool summer two years ago". Such ad-hoc queries would require recomputing the Matrix Profile for the time period in question. This is not an untenable computation, but it could not be done in interactive time. In this work we introduce a novel indexing framework that allows queries about arbitrary ranges to be answered in quasilinear time, allowing such queries to be interactive for the first time. © 2020 IEEE.},

Time series motif discovery is an essential and important task in time series mining. Several algorithms have been proposed to discover motifs in time series. These algorithms require user-defined parameters such as length of the motif, support or confidence. However, selection of these parameters is not an easy issue. To overcome the challenge, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm with constraints to discover good trade-off between representative and interesting motif. The discovered motifs are validated for their potential interest in time series classification problem using nearest neighbour classifier. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can efficiently discover motifs with different length and to be more accurate and statistically significant than state-of-the-art time series techniques.

	abstract = {Service computing is an emerging technology in System of Systems Engineering (SoS Engineering or SoSE), which regards a System as a Service, and aims at constructing a robust and value-added complex system by outsourcing external component systems through service composition. The burgeoning Big Service computing just covers the significant challenges in constructing and maintaining a stable service-oriented SoS. A service-oriented SoS runs under a volatile and uncertain environment. As a step toward big service, service fault tolerance (FT) can guarantee the run-time quality of a service-oriented SoS. To successfully deploy FT in an SoS, online reliability time series prediction, which aims at predicting the reliability in near future for a service-oriented SoS arises as a grand challenge in SoS research. In particular, we need to tackle a number of big data related issues given the large and fast increasing size of the historical data that will be used for prediction purpose. The decision-making of prediction solution space be more complex. To provide highly accurate prediction results, we tackle the prediction challenges by identifying the evolution regularities of component systems' running states via different machine learning models. We present in this paper the motifs-based Dynamic Bayesian Networks (or m-DBNs) to perform one-step-ahead online reliability time series prediction. We also propose a multi-steps trajectory DBNs (or multi-DBNs) to further improve the accuracy of future reliability prediction. Finally, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based prediction approach is developed to deal with the big data challenges.

According to him it is only the statistical nature of information that matters. Semantic information is on the other hand, meaning of the information. Pattern recognition plays a big role in neural signal processing. Patterns can be thought of encoded semantic information in neural signals. In neuroscience both types of information have been studied extensively, without ever mentioning the term “semantic information,” whereas “Shannon information” has become a household name among the neuroscientists, often even without the term “Shannon.” In fact, neural information in general is a combination of both. In this review we highlight Shannon information theoretical aspects and semantic information theoretical aspects in neural information processing.

	abstract = {Horizontal visibility graph (HVG) motifs have been recently introduced to analyze the dynamical information encoded by biological signals. However, the result of the analysis strongly depends on the selected window size of the motifs. Different sizes ranging from 3 to 5 have been previously used, but such small window sizes are insufficient to cope with the complexity of biological systems and often fail to extract salient features of the encoded information. It is known that larger window size increases the total number of possible motifs, and it leads to the distribution of the statistics into too many motifs, which causes each individual motif to contain too little information and make it even more difficult to reliably detect system dynamics. To resolve this problem, we group the motifs based on the number of edges. Using the grouped motifs, we propose grouped horizontal visibility entropy (GHVE) to quantify the complexity based on the probability distribution of the observations within these groups. We apply GHVE to quantify the complexity of simulated white and 1/f noise. The results reveal that the 1/f noise time series exhibits a higher complexity than white noise time series, which indicates that the 1/f noise is structurally more complex than white Gaussian noise. We apply the method for analyzing interbeat intervals time series. The results show that the proposed GHVE measure is more accurate in distinguishing healthy and pathological subjects than its non-grouped counter-part HVG.

	abstract = {Time series classification is one of the crucial tasks in time series data mining. Due to the unique characteristics of time series, most classic classification algorithms in data mining do not work well for time series. So far, empirical evidence has shown that the nearest neighbor method is very effective to classify directly time series data without any feature extraction step. Recently, there have been two research works that proposed a framework for time series classification which uses motif information to convert time series to feature vectors. This framework facilitates the use of classical classification algorithms for time series classification. In this paper, we present an effective implementation of the framework. In our method we exploit the motif discovery algorithm which combines EP-C, a segmentation-based motif discovery method and MK, an exact motif discovery method. Furthermore, we devise a segmentation-based method that helps in transforming efficiently a set of time series to a set of feature-vectors. Experimental results on benchmark datasets reveal that our proposed implementation method for motif-based time series classification improves the accuracy of not only 1-nearest neighbor algorithm but also SVMs and ANNs for time series classification. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) secondary to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a public health concern. The current study aimed to investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their possible function in HF post‑myocardial infarction. The GSE59867 dataset included microarray data from peripheral blood samples obtained from HF and non‑HF patients following AMI at 4 time points (admission, discharge, and 1 and 6 months post‑A MI). Time‑series DEGs were analyzed using R Bioconductor. Functional enrichment analysis was performed, followed by analysis of protein‑protein interactions (PPIs). A total of 108 DEGs on admission, 32 DEGs on discharge, 41 DEGs at 1 month post‑A MI and 19 DEGs at 6 months post‑AMI were identified. Among these DEGs, 4 genes were downregulated at all the 4 time points. These included fatty acid desaturase 2, leucine rich repeat neuronal protein 3, G‑protein coupled receptor 15 and adenylate kinase 5. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in 'inflammatory response', 'immune response', 'toll‑like receptor signaling pathway' and 'NF‑κβ signaling pathway'. Furthermore, PPI network analysis revealed that C‑ X‑C motif chemokine ligand 8 and interleukin 1β were hub genes. The current study identified candidate DE Gs and pathways that may serve important roles in the development of HF following AMI. The results obtained in the current study may guide the development of novel therapeutic agents for HF following AMI. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.},

	abstract = {As companies are increasingly measuring their products and services, the amount of time series data is rising and techniques to extract usable information are needed. One recently developed data mining technique for time series is the Matrix Profile. It consists of the smallest z-normalized Euclidean distance of each subsequence of a time series to all other subsequences of another series. It has been used for motif and discord discovery, for segmentation and as building block for other techniques. One side effect of the z-normalization used is that small fluctuations on flat signals are upscaled. This can lead to high and unintuitive distances for very similar subsequences from noisy data. We determined an analytic method to estimate and remove the effects of this noise, adding only a single, intuitive parameter to the calculation of the Matrix Profile. This paper explains our method and demonstrates it by performing discord discovery on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark and by segmenting the PAMAP2 activity dataset. We find that our technique results in a more intuitive Matrix Profile and provides improved results in both usecases for series containing many flat, noisy subsequences. Since our technique is an extension of the Matrix Profile, it can be applied to any of the various tasks that could be solved by it, improving results where data contains flat and noisy sequences. © 2019 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

	abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental molecular mechanism involved in almost every aspect of life, from homeostasis to development, from metabolism to behavior, from reaction to stimuli to disease progression. In recent years, the concept of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) has grown popular as an effective applied biology approach for describing the complex and highly dynamic set of transcriptional interactions, due to its easy-to-interpret features. Since cataloguing, predicting and understanding every GRN connection in all species and cellular contexts remains a great challenge for biology, researchers have developed numerous tools and methods to infer regulatory processes. In this review, we catalogue these methods in six major areas, based on the dominant underlying information leveraged to infer GRNs: Coexpression, Sequence Motifs, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Orthology, Literature and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) specifically focused on transcriptional complexes. The methods described here cover a wide range of user-friendliness: from web tools that require no prior computational expertise to command line programs and algorithms for large scale GRN inferences. Each method for GRN inference described herein effectively illustrates a type of transcriptional relationship, with many methods being complementary to others. While a truly holistic approach for inferring and displaying GRNs remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of systems biology, we believe that the integration of multiple methods described herein provides an effective means with which experimental and computational biologists alike may obtain the most complete pictures of transcriptional relationships.

The data from these sensors can be used to estimate characteristics of manual processes in a manufacturing environment. The goal of this research is to determine cycle times of manually performed assembly processes using data from wrist-worn inertial sensors. Specifically, this work explores an unsupervised method of analyzing time series data to extract patterns (motifs) which represent individual cycles of an operation. From here, cycle time is computed by applying knowledge of the frequency of data collection. Testing shows that the mean cycle times obtained from stopwatch are statistically indifferent from those obtained from the proposed approach. Furthermore, results suggest that the proposed approach is insensitive to high frequency noise in the data. These encouraging results warrant further investigation and more testing.

	abstract = {Characteristics of the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex are examined using reanalysis data with dynamic time warping (DTW) and a clustering technique to determine whether the polar vortex exhibits canonical signs of preconditioning prior to sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). The DTW and clustering technique is used to locate time series motifs in vortex area, vortex edge-averaged PV gradients, and vortex edge-averaged wind speeds. Composites of the motifs reveal that prior to roughly 75% of SSWs, in the middle to upper stratosphere, PV gradients and wind speeds in the vortex edge region increase, and vortex area decreases. These signs agree with prior studies that discuss potential signals of preconditioning of the vortex. However, similar motifs are also found in a majority of years without SSWs. While such non-SSW motifs are strongly associated with minor warming signals apparent only in the middle and upper stratosphere, only roughly half of these can be associated with later ‘‘significant disturbances’’ (SDs) that do not quite meet the threshold for major SSWs. The median lead time for sharpening vortex edge PV gradients represented in the motifs prior to SSWs and SDs is;25 days, while the median lead time for the vortex area and edge wind speeds is;10 days. Overall, canonical signs of preconditioning do appear to exist prior to SSWs, but their existence in years without SSWs implies that preconditioning of the vortex may be an insufficient condition for the occurrence of SSWs. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.},

Permutation entropy is one of the most prevalent algorithms for measuring the complexity of time series, but it fails to account for amplitude information with outliers and noise in such time series. Though weighted-permutation entropy aims to incorporate amplitude information by counterweighing the motif with its variance, it mixes noise and outliers with abrupt changes, which have a negative effect on the analysis result. To overcome this problem, this chapter proposes a refined weighted-permutation entropy by assigning fewer weights to outliers and more weights to regular spiky patterns according to the normal distribution function. The refined weighted-permutation entropy is used to analyze simulated synthetic signals with noise and outliers. The comparative analyses with the permutation entropy and weighted-permutation entropy are also performed. Moreover, human gait and ECG experimental data are analyzed by the proposed method. The results demonstrate its better robustness and stability than traditional methods in distinguishing different states of human gait and physiologic signals.  © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Recently, the Matrix Profile method, and particularly one of its implementations—the SCRIMP algorithm—has become a state-of-the-art approach in this field. This is a technique that brings the possibility of obtaining exact motifs from a time series, which can be used to infer events, predict outcomes, detect anomalies and more. However, the memory-bound nature of the SCRIMP algorithm limits the execution performance in some processor architectures. In this paper, we analyze the SCRIMP algorithm from the performance viewpoint in the context of the Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing architecture (KNL), which integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) modules, and we combine several techniques aimed at exploiting the potential of this architecture. On the one hand, we exploit the multi-threading and vector capabilities of the architecture. On the other hand, we explore how to allocate data in order to take advantage of the available hybrid memory architecture that conjugates both the high-bandwidth 3D-stacked HBM and the DDR4 memory modules. The experimental evaluation shows a performance improvement up to 190× with respect to the sequential execution and that the use of the HBM memory improves performance in a factor up to 5× with respect to the DDR4 memory. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Until two decades ago, industrial networks were deemed secure due to physical separation from public networks. An abundance of successful attacks proved that assumption wrong. Intrusion detection solutions for industrial application need to meet certain requirements that differ from home- and office-environments, such as working without feedback to the process and compatibility with legacy systems. Industrial systems are commonly used for several decades, updates are often difficult and expensive. Furthermore, most industrial protocols do not have inherent authentication or encryption mechanisms, allowing for easy lateral movement of an intruder once the perimeter is breached. In this work, an algorithm for motif discovery in time series, Matrix Profiles, is used to detect outliers in the timing behaviour of an industrial process. This process was monitored in an experimental environment, containing ground truth labels after attacks were performed. Furthermore, the graph representations of a different industrial data set that has been emulated are used to detect malicious activities. These activities can be derived from anomalous communication patterns, represented as edges in the graph. Finally, an integration concept for both methods is proposed. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the transition of thermo-acoustic instability of supercritical hydrocarbon fuel flow is a fundamental problem eliciting a great deal of attention from different disciplines. We experimentally and theoretically investigate the transition process between thermo-acoustic stability and instability. The method of recurrence network is applied to analyze the pressure time series of supercritical hydrocarbon fuel flow. As a result, we can distinguish a thermo-acoustic transition process from normal signals by real-time detecting the complexity variation of pressure signals of fuel in cooling channels with the recurrence network method. Then, we construct the recurrence network from experimental data under the stable, transition and unstable states, and investigate the degree distribution and motifs distribution. We find that the degree distribution and motifs distribution allow quantitatively uncovering the complexity dynamic process. We investigate the during time of transition process, and find that the mass flow rate and the inlet pressure will make an influence on the transition time. These findings present a first step towards an improved understanding on the transition of thermo-acoustic instability from a complex network perspective. Moreover, the investigation on the transition of thermo-acoustic instability under supercritical pressure condition offers guidance on the control of scramjet fuel supply, which can secure stable fuel flowing in regenerative cooling system. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {Numerical time series data are pervasive, originating from sources as diverse as wearable devices, medical equipment, to sensors in industrial plants. In many cases, time series contain interesting information in terms of subsequences that recur in approximate form, so-called motifs. Major open challenges in this area include how one can formalize the interestingness of such motifs and how the most interesting ones can be found. We introduce a novel approach that tackles these issues. We formalize the notion of such subsequence patterns in an intuitive manner and present an information-theoretic approach for quantifying their interestingness with respect to any prior expectation a user may have about the time series. The resulting interestingness measure is thus a subjective measure, enabling a user to find motifs that are truly interesting to them. Although finding the best motif appears computationally intractable, we develop relaxations and a branch-and-bound approach implemented in a constraint programming solver. As shown in experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets, this enables us to mine interesting patterns in small or mid-sized time series. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {HrdB in streptomycetes is a principal sigma factor whose deletion is lethal. This is also the reason why its regulon has not been investigated so far. To overcome experimental obstacles, for investigating the HrdB regulon, we constructed a strain whose HrdB protein was tagged by an HA epitope. ChIP-seq experiment, done in 3 repeats, identified 2137 protein-coding genes organized in 337 operons, 75 small RNAs, 62 tRNAs, 6 rRNAs and 3 miscellaneous RNAs. Subsequent kinetic modeling of regulation of protein-coding genes with HrdB alone and with a complex of HrdB and a transcriptional cofactor RbpA, using gene expression time series, identified 1694 genes that were under their direct control. When using the HrdB-RbpA complex in the model, an increase of the model fidelity was found for 322 genes. Functional analysis revealed that HrdB controls the majority of gene groups essential for the primary metabolism and the vegetative growth. Particularly, almost all ribosomal protein-coding genes were found in the HrdB regulon. Analysis of promoter binding sites revealed binding motif at the -10 region and suggested the possible role of mono-or di-nucleotides upstream of the -10 element. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Firstly, we symbolize our time-series data with alphabets and classify those data. Then we evaluate our method by checking error rates of different settings. Later, we test our algorithm with different training and testing datasets. The motif-based classification algorithm analyzes electricity consumption data of households.

	abstract = {Discovering frequently occurring patterns (or motifs) in time series has many real-life applications in financial data, streaming media data, meteorological data, and sensor data. It is challenging to provide efficient motif discovery algorithms when the time series is big. Existing motif discovery algorithms trying to improve the performance can be classified into two categories: (i) reducing the computation cost but keeping the original time series dimensions; and (ii) applying feature representation models to reduce the dimensions. However, both of them have limitations when scaling to big time series. The performance of the first category algorithms heavily rely on the size of the dimension of the original time series, which performs bad when the time series is big. The second category algorithms cannot guarantee the original similarity properties, which means originally similar patterns may be identified as dissimilar. To address the limitations, we provide an efficient motif discovery algorithm, called FastM, which can reduce dimensions and maintain the similarity properties. FastM extends the deep neural network stacked AutoEncoder by introducing new central loss functions based on labels assigned by clustering algorithms. Comprehensive experimental results on three real-life datasets demonstrate both the high efficiency and accuracy of FastM. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, due to the high volatility and non-stationary nature of the stock market, forecasting the trend of a financial time series remains a big challenge.

	abstract = {Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are reconstructed from the microarray gene expression data through diversified computational approaches. This process ensues in symmetric and diagonal interaction of gene pairs that cannot be modelled as direct activation, inhibition, and self-regulatory interactions. The values of gene co-expressions could help in identifying co-regulations among them. The proposed approach aims at computing the differences in variances of co-expressed genes rather than computing differences in values of mean expressions across experimental conditions. It adopts multivariate co-variances using principal component analysis (PCA) to predict an asymmetric and non-diagonal gene interaction matrix, to select only those gene pair interactions that exhibit the maximum variances in gene regulatory expressions. The asymmetric gene regulatory interactions help in identifying the controlling regulatory agents, thus lowering the false positive rate by minimizing the connections between previously unlinked network components. The experimental results on real as well as in silico datasets including time-series RTX therapy, Arabidopsis thaliana, DREAM-3, and DREAM-8 datasets, in comparison with existing state-of-the-art approaches demonstrated the enhanced performance of the proposed approach for predicting positive and negative feedback loops and self-regulatory interactions. The generated GRNs hold the potential in determining the real nature of gene pair regulatory interactions. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.},

	abstract = {Time series are one of the most common data types in nature. Given this fact, there are dozens of query-by-sketching/ query-by-example/ query-algebra systems proposed to allow users to search large time series collections. However, none of these systems have seen widespread adoption. We argue that there are two reasons why this is so. The first reason is that these systems are often complex and unintuitive, requiring the user to understand complex syntax/interfaces to construct high-quality queries. The second reason is less well appreciated. The expressiveness of most query-by-content systems is surprisingly limited. There are well defined, simple queries that cannot be answered by any current query-by-content system, even if it uses a state-of-the-art distance measure such as Dynamic Time Warping. In this work, we propose a natural language search mechanism for searching time series. We show that our system is expressive, intuitive, and requires little space and time overhead. Because our system is text-based, it can leverage decades of research text retrieval, including ideas such as relevance feedback. Moreover, we show that our system subsumes both motif/discord discovery and most existing query-by-content systems in the literature. We demonstrate the utility of our system with case studies in domains as diverse as animal motion studies, medicine and industry. � 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 License.},

As the motifs can reveal much useful information, time series motif discovery has been received extensive attentions in recent years. Time series motif discovery is an important operation for time series analysis in many fields, such as financial data analysis, medical and health monitoring. Although many algorithms have been proposed for motifs discovery, most of existing works are running on single node and focusing on finding fixed-length motifs. They cannot process very long time series efficiently. However, the length of motifs cannot be predicted previously, and the Euclidean distance has many drawbacks as the similarity measure. In this work, we propose a parallel algorithm based on subsequences correlation called as PMDSC (Parallel Motif Discovery based on Subsequences Correlation), which can be applied to find time series motifs with variable lengths. We have conducted extensive experiments on public data sets, the results demonstrate that our method can efficiently find variable-length motifs in long time series. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

We derived a framework that focuses on the implicit distance matrix calculation. We present this framework as the Series Distance Matrix (SDM). In this framework, distance measures (SDM-generators) and distance processors (SDM-consumers) can be freely combined, allowing for more flexibility and easier experimentation. In SDM, the Matrix Profile is but one specific configuration. We also introduce the Contextual Matrix Profile (CMP) as a new SDM-consumer capable of discovering repeating patterns. The CMP provides intuitive visualizations for data analysis and can find anomalies that are not discords. We demonstrate this using two real world cases. The CMP is the first of a wide variety of new techniques for series analysis that fits within SDM and can complement the Matrix Profile. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {It is of great significance to identify the characteristics of time series to quantify their similarity and classify different classes of time series. We define six types of triadic time-series motifs and investigate the motif occurrence profiles extracted from the time series. Based on triadic time series motif profiles, we further propose to estimate the similarity coefficients between different time series and classify these time series with high accuracy. We validate the method with time series generated from nonlinear dynamic systems (logistic map, chaotic logistic map, chaotic Henon map, chaotic Ikeda map, hyperchaotic generalized Henon map and hyperchaotic folded-tower map) and retrieved from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. Our analysis shows that the proposed triadic time series motif analysis performs better than the classic dynamic time wrapping method in classifying time series for certain datasets investigated in this work. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

These repeated maneuvers can be extracted by analyzing the inputs and outputs of the human operator using control theory and data mining tools. In this paper, we introduce geometrical shape-based pattern detection approach for input-output data. A pattern or a maneuver is defined as the maximum repeated behavior in time series trajectory data that is generated from the operator's inputs and outputs. A two-phase algorithm is developed in this paper, the first phase consists of trajectory segmentation, creating segment fingerprint, clustering, and symbolic representations. The second phase of the proposed algorithm is pattern extraction phase, which is inherited from the motif finding algorithms in time series data and DNA sequences. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {Ecosystems functioning is based on an intricate web of interactions among living entities. Most of these interactions are difficult to observe, especially when the diversity of interacting entities is large and they are of small size and abundance. To sidestep this limitation, it has become common to infer the network structure of ecosystems from time series of species abundance, but it is not clear how well can networks be reconstructed, especially in the presence of stochasticity that propagates through ecological networks. We evaluate the effects of intrinsic noise and network topology on the performance of different methods of inferring network structure from timeseries data. Analysis of seven different four-species motifs using a stochastic model demonstrates that star-shaped motifs are differentially detected by these methods while rings are differentially constructed. The ability to reconstruct the network is unaffected by the magnitude of stochasticity in the population dynamics. Instead, interaction between the stochastic and deterministic parts of the system determines the path that the whole system takes to equilibrium and shapes the species covariance. We highlight the effects of long transients on the path to equilibrium and suggest a path forward for developing more ecologically sound statistical techniques. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Careful analysis of individuals' deviations or variations in movement over time can provide an awareness about changes to their physical or mental state and may be helpful in tracking performance and well-being especially in workplace settings. We propose a technique for clustering and discovering patterns in human movement data by extracting motifs from the time series of durations where participants linger at different locations. Using a data set of over 200 participants moving around a hospital for ten weeks, we show this technique intuitively captures local temporal relationships between hospital rooms and also clusters them in a fashion consistent with the room type labels (e.g. lounge, break room, etc.) without using prior knowledge. Machine learning features derived from these clusters are empirically shown to provide information similar to features attained using domain knowledge of the room type labels directly when predicting mental wellness from self-reports. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms, which form the core intelligence of wearables, traditionally deduce a computational model from a set of training data to detect events of interest. However, in the dynamic environment in which wearables operate, the accuracy of a computational model drops whenever changes in configuration or context of the system occur. In this paper, using transfer learning as an organizing principle, we propose a novel design framework to enable autonomous reconfiguration of wearable systems. More specifically, we focus on the cases where the specifications of sensor(s) or the subject vary compared to what is available in the training data. We develop two new algorithms for data mapping (the mapping is between the training data and the data for the current operating setting). The first data mapping algorithm combines effective methods for finding signal similarity with network-based clustering, while the second algorithm is based on finding signal motifs. The data mapping algorithms constitute the centerpiece of the transfer learning phase in our framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of the data mapping algorithms using two publicly available datasets on human activity recognition. We show that the data mapping algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster compared to a brute-force approach. We also show that the proposed framework overall improves activity recognition accuracy by up to 15 percent for the first dataset and by up to 32 percent for the second dataset. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

Genetic selection for resistant animals is a promising control strategy. Whole-transcriptome analysis via RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) provides knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for complex traits such as resistance to GIN infections. In this study, we used RNA-seq to monitor the dynamics of the response of the abomasal mucosa of Creole goat kids infected with Haemonchus contortus by comparing resistant and susceptible genotypes. A total of 8 cannulated kids, 4 susceptible and 4 resistant to GIN, were infected twice with 10 000 L3 H. contortus. During the second infection, abomasal mucosal biopsies were collected at 0, 8, 15 and 35 days post-infection (dpi) from all kids for RNA-seq analysis. The resistant animals showed early activation of biological processes related to the immune response. The top 20 canonical pathways of differentially expressed genes for different comparison showed activation of the immune response through many relevant pathways including the Th1 response. Interestingly, our results showed a simultaneous time series activation of Th2 related genes in resistant compared to susceptible kids. © 2020 The Author(s).},

However, all these methods are distance-based which get the similarity by accumulating the distances between optimal match pairs and ignore the intrinsic differences of time series. In order to solve the drawback, we discard this distance-based technique and design a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network(SCNN) to obtain the similarity of time series in this paper. Concretely, we first extract the essential features for similarity calculation by Convolutional Neural Network and then ontain the absolute difference between the essential features of time series. To conveniently train the proposed model, we make full use of the label information of datasets and construct a new binary dataset which each example contains two original time series and a binary label. In the proposed Siamese network, the parameters are shared between two branches and we take binary cross-entropy function to train our model. Experimental results on synthetic and real time series datasets show that our SCNN model is effective and achieves improved accuracy for time series classification task compared to other time series similarity calculation methods. © 2019 IEEE.},

As a result, two segments with different shapes but similar average values are transformed into the same symbol. In this paper, we first propose Entropy-based Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (EN_SAX) to overcome this drawback. The EN_SAX improves the original SAX by capturing an additional characteristic in a segment by using the time-series entropy. Then we present a modified similarity measurement to compute the similarity between pairwise time-series. We extensively compare EN_SAX with state-of-the-art improved SAX approaches in time-series classification framework using ten real-life datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal.

As for streaming time series, incremental clustering can be used in some advanced time series data mining tasks such as anomaly detection and motif discovery. In this paper, we propose a novel incremental clustering method for time series. The proposed method is an improved variant of the Leader algorithm, called I-Leader. Leader is a well-known incremental clustering method which is a single-pass distance-based partitional clustering method. However, Leader suffers from some weaknesses such as producing not good clustering result which consists of a large number of clusters and therefore requiring a lot of time for clustering. To overcome these weaknesses of Leader, in I-Leader we employ a data summarization technique and use this data summarization to maintain the high quality for the clusters. We have conducted some experiments on several datasets to compare the performance of the I-Leader algorithm with that of the original Leader in time series clustering. Besides, we compare I-Leader with k-Means. The experimental results show that our I-Leader algorithm runs faster than both Leader and k-Means. I-Leader is also more effective than both of these algorithms with better clustering results. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Energy efficiency and sustainability are important factors to address in the context of smart cities. In this sense, smart metering and nonintrusive load monitoring play a crucial role in fighting energy thefts and for optimizing the energy consumption of the home, building, city, and so forth. The estimated number of smart meters will exceed 800 million by 2020. By providing near real-time data about power consumption, smart meters can be used to analyze electricity usage trends and to point out anomalies guaranteeing companies' safety and avoiding energy wastes. In literature, there are many proposals approaching the problem of anomaly detection. Most of them are limited because they lack context and time awareness and the false positive rate is affected by the change in consumer habits. This research work focuses on the need to define anomaly detection method capable of facing the concept drift, for instance, family structure changes; a house becomes a second residence, and so forth. The proposed methodology adopts long short term memory network in order to profile and forecast the consumers' behavior based on their recent past consumptions. The continuous monitoring of the consumption prediction errors allows us to distinguish between possible anomalies and changes (drifts) in normal behavior that correspond to different error motifs. The experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed framework by pointing out an anomaly in a near real-time after a training period of one week. © 2013 IEEE.},

Semi-supervised Motif Discovery finds hidden patterns in long time series when a few arbitrarily known patterns are given. A naive approach is to exploit the known patterns and perform similarity search within a radius of the patterns. However, this method would find only similar shapes and would be limited in discovering new shapes. In contrast, traditional unsupervised motif discovery algorithms detect new shapes, while missing some patterns because the given information is not utilized. We propose a semi-supervised motif discovery algorithm that forms a nearest neighbor graph to identify chains of nearest neighbors from the given events. We demonstrate that the chains are likely to identify hidden patterns in the data. We have applied the method to find novel events in several geoscientific datasets more accurately than existing methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Time Series Analysis has long been used as a method to help predict future events based on previous data. This area is well-defined and studied but there are still areas of Time Series Analysis that are problematic. One such problem is isolating patterns in highly volatile datasets over long time intervals. In an effort to help with such issues e.g. those seen in fluctuating financial datasets, a new approach is needed. Borrowing its name from Music and more recently Computational Biology, Motifs are small repeating patterns in datasets. Using these subsequences, further forecasting can be improved as Motifs can be shown to aid algorithms which require certain initial conditions. This method will potentially lead to new insights in the study of cryptocurrencies. This paper will present a case where an optimized Motif length will be used to aid the prediction of Bitcoin through the use of an LSTM Neural Network, yielding an 8% decrease in RSME for one test case.

	abstract = {Representation learning for time series has gained increasing attention in healthcare domain. The recent advancement in semantic learning allows researcher to learn meaningful deep representations of clinical medical concepts from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, existing models cannot deal with continuous physiological records, which are often included in EHRs. The major challenges for this task are to model non-obvious representations from observed high-resolution biosignals, and to interpret the learned features. To address these issues, we propose Wave2Vec, an end-to-end deep representation learning model, to bridge the gap between biosignal processing and semantic learning. Wave2Vec not only jointly learns both inherent and temporal representations of biosignals, but also allows us to interpret the learned representations reasonably over time. We propose two embedding mechanisms to capture the temporal knowledge within signals, and discover latent knowledge from signals in time-frequency domain, namely component-based motifs. To validate the effectiveness of our model in clinical task, we carry out experiments on two real-world benchmark biosignal datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Wave2Vec model outperforms six feature learning baselines in biosignal processing. Analytical results show that the proposed model can incorporate both motif co-occurrence information and time series information of biosignals, and hence provides clinically meaningful interpretation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, we extended the analysis of the FANTOM5 Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) transcriptome data to focus on understanding the genetic regulators involved in mouse cerebellar development. Results: We used the HeliScopeCAGE library sequencing on cerebellar samples over 8 embryonic and 4 early postnatal times. This study showcases temporal expression pattern changes during cerebellar development. Through a bioinformatics analysis that focused on transcription factors, their promoters and binding sites, we identified genes that appear as strong candidates for involvement in cerebellar development. We selected several candidate transcriptional regulators for validation experiments including qRT-PCR and shRNA transcript knockdown. We observed marked and reproducible developmental defects in Atf4, Rfx3, and Scrt2 knockdown embryos, which support the role of these genes in cerebellar development. Conclusions: The successful identification of these novel gene regulators in cerebellar development demonstrates that the FANTOM5 cerebellum time series is a high-quality transcriptome database for functional investigation of gene regulatory networks in cerebellar development. © 2019 The Author(s).},

In this work, we introduce Time Series Chains, which are related to, but distinct from, time series motifs. Informally, time series chains are a temporally ordered set of subsequence patterns, such that each pattern is similar to the pattern that preceded it, but the first and last patterns can be arbitrarily dissimilar. In the discrete space, this is similar to extracting the text chain “data, date, cate, cade, code” from text stream. The first and last words have nothing in common, yet they are connected by a chain of words with a small mutual difference. Time series chains can capture the evolution of systems, and help predict the future. As such, they potentially have implications for prognostics. In this work, we introduce two robust definitions of time series chains and scalable algorithms that allow us to discover them in massive complex datasets. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised time series mining has been attracting great interest from both academic and industrial communities. As the two most basic data mining tasks, the discoveries of frequent/rare subsequences have been extensively studied in the literature. Specifically, frequent/rare subsequences are defined as the ones with the smallest/largest 1-nearest neighbor distance, which are also known as motif/discord. However, discord fails to identify rare subsequences when it occurs more than once in the time series, which is widely known as the twin freak problem. This problem is just the "tip of the iceberg" due to the 1-nearest neighbor distance based definitions. In this work, we for the first time provide a clear theoretical analysis of motif/discord as the 1-nearest neighbor based nonparametric density estimation of subsequence. Particularly, we focus on matrix profile, a recently proposed mining framework, which unifies the discovery of motif and discord under the same computing model. Thereafter, we point out the inherent three issues: low-quality density estimation, gravity defiant behavior, and lack of reusable model, which deteriorate the performance of matrix profile in both efficiency and subsequence quality.To overcome these issues, we propose Neighbor Profile to robustly model the subsequence density by bagging nearest neighbors for the discovery of frequent/rare subsequences. Specifically, we leverage multiple subsamples and average the density estimations from subsamples using adjusted nearest neighbor distances, which not only enhances the estimation robustness but also realizes a reusable model for efficient learning. We check the sanity of neighbor profile on synthetic data and further evaluate it on real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that neighbor profile can correctly model the subsequences of different densities and shows superior performance significantly over matrix profile on the real-world arrhythmia dataset. Also, it is shown that neighbor profile is efficient for massive datasets. © 2020 IEEE.},

Called time series motifs, these primitive patterns are useful in their own right, and are also used as inputs into classification, clustering, segmentation, visualization, and anomaly detection algorithms. Recently the Matrix Profile has emerged as a promising representation to allow the efficient exact computation of the top-k motifs in a time series. State-of-The-Art algorithms for computing the Matrix Profile are fast enough for many tasks. However, in a handful of domains, including astronomy and seismology, there is an insatiable appetite to consider ever larger datasets. In this work we show that with several novel insights we can push the motif discovery envelope using a novel scalable framework in conjunction with a deployment to commercial GPU clusters in the cloud. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with detailed case studies in seismology, demonstrating that the efficiency of our algorithm allows us to exhaustively consider datasets that are currently only approximately searchable, allowing us to find subtle precursor earthquakes that had previously escaped attention, and other novel seismic regularities. © 2019 ACM.},

Specifically, for the temporal data containing real numbers, it is formulated as time series motif mining (TSMM) problem. If the input is alphabetical and edit-distance is considered, this is called Edit-distance Motif Search (EMS). In EMS, the problem of interest is to find a pattern of length l which occurs with an edit-distance of at most d in each of the input sequences. There exists some algorithms proposed in the literature to solve EMS problem. However, in terms of challenging instances and large datasets, they are still not efficient. In this paper, EMS3, a motif mining algorithm, that advances the state-of-the-art EMS solvers by exploiting the idea of projection is proposed.

	abstract = {The role of stromal fibroblasts in chronic inflammation is unfolding. In rheumatoid arthritis, leukocyte-derived cytokines TNF and IL-17A work together, activating fibroblasts to become a dominant source of the hallmark cytokine IL-6. However, IL-17A alone has minimal effect on fibroblasts. To identify key mediators of the synergistic response to TNF and IL-17A in human synovial fibroblasts, we performed time series, dose–response, and gene-silencing transcriptomics experiments. Here we show that in combination with TNF, IL-17A selectively induces a specific set of genes mediated by factors including cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1) and IκBζ (NFKBIZ). In the promoters of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3, we found a putative CUX1–NFκB binding motif not found elsewhere in the genome. CUX1 and NF-κB p65 mediate transcription of these genes independent of LIFR, STAT3, STAT4, and ELF3. Transcription of NFKBIZ, encoding the atypical IκB factor IκBζ, is IL-17A dose-dependent, and IκBζ only mediates the transcriptional response to TNF and IL-17A, but not to TNF alone. In fibroblasts, IL-17A response depends on CUX1 and IκBζ to engage the NF-κB complex to produce chemoattractants for neutrophil and monocyte recruitment. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Time series motifs are approximately repeated patterns in real-valued temporal data. They are used for exploratory data mining methods including clustering, classification, segmentation, and rule discovery. Their current definition is limited to finding literal or near-exact matches and is unable to discover higher level semantic structure. Consider a time series generated by an accelerometer on a smartwatch. This data offers the possibility of finding motifs in human behavior. One such example is the motif generated by a handshake. Under current motif definitions, a single-pump handshake would not match a three-pump handshake, even though they are culturally and semantically equivalent events. In this work we generalize the definition of motifs to one which allows us to capture higher level semantic structure. We refer to these as time series semantic motifs. Surprisingly this increased expressiveness does not come at a great cost. Our algorithm Semantic-Motif-Finder takes approximately the same time as current state-of-the-art motif discovery algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our ideas on diverse datasets. © 2019 IEEE.},

The profiles of tetradic motifs contain the spatial information (visibility) and temporal information (relative magnitude) among the data points in the corresponding time series. For multifractal binomial measures, the occurrence frequencies of the tetradic motifs are determined, which converge to a constant vector (2/3, 0, 8/99, 8/33, 1/99, 0). For fractional Gaussian noises, the motif occurrence frequencies are found to depend nonlinearly on the Hurst exponent and the length of time series. These findings suggest the potential ability of tetradic motif profiles in distinguishing different types of time series.

The algorithm is further modified to find all pairs of subsequences whose distances are below a given threshold value. In practice, if true motifs exist in the data or the threshold is set to a small value, the algorithms are very fast.

Time series motifs consider not only the spatial information of mutual visibility but also the temporal information of relative magnitude between the data points. We study the profiles of the six triadic time series motifs. The six motif occurrence frequencies are derived for uncorrelated time series, which are approximately linear functions of the length of the time series. The corresponding motif profile thus converges to a constant vector. These analytical results have been verified by numerical simulations. For fractional Gaussian noises, numerical simulations unveil the nonlinear dependence of motif occurrence frequencies on the Hurst exponent. Applications of the time series motif analysis uncover that the motif occurrence frequency distributions are able to capture the different dynamics in the heartbeat rates of healthy subjects, congestive heart failure (CHF) subjects, and atrial fibrillation (AF) subjects and in the price fluctuations of bullish and bearish markets.

	abstract = {Crop disease leads to significant waste worldwide, both pre- and postharvest, with subsequent economic and sustainability consequences. Disease outcome is determined both by the plants' response to the pathogen and by the ability of the pathogen to suppress defense responses and manipulate the plant to enhance colonization. The defense response of a plant is characterized by significant transcriptional reprogramming mediated by underlying gene regulatory networks, and components of these networks are often targeted by attacking pathogens. Here, using gene expression data from Botrytis cinerea-infected Arabidopsis plants, we develop a systematic approach for mitigating the effects of pathogen-induced network perturbations, using the tools of synthetic biology. We employ network inference and system identification techniques to build an accurate model of an Arabidopsis defense subnetwork that contains key genes determining susceptibility of the plant to the pathogen attack. Once validated against time-series data, we use this model to design and test perturbation mitigation strategies based on the use of genetic feedback control. We show how a synthetic feedback controller can be designed to attenuate the effect of external perturbations on the transcription factor CHE in our subnetwork. We investigate and compare two approaches for implementing such a controller biologically - direct implementation of the genetic feedback controller, and rewiring the regulatory regions of multiple genes - to achieve the network motif required to implement the controller. Our results highlight the potential of combining feedback control theory with synthetic biology for engineering plants with enhanced resilience to environmental stress. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The disease white mold caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a significant threat to pea production, and improved resistance to this disease is needed. Nodal resistance in plants is a phenomenon where a fungal infection is prevented from passing through a node, and the infection is limited to an internode region. Nodal resistance has been observed in some pathosystems such as the pea (Pisum sativum L.)-S. sclerotiorum pathosystem. In addition to nodal resistance, different pea lines display different levels of stem lesion size restriction, referred to as lesion resistance. It is unclear whether the genetics of lesion resistance and nodal resistance are identical or different. This study applied genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and RNA-Seq to understand the genetic makeup of these two types of resistance. The time series RNA-Seq experiment consisted of two pea lines (the susceptible ‘Lifter’ and the partially resistant PI 240515), two treatments (mock inoculated samples and S. sclerotiorum-inoculated samples), and three time points (12, 24, and 48 hr post inoculation). Integrated results from GWAS and RNA-Seq analyses identified different redox-related transcripts for lesion and nodal resistances. A transcript encoding a glutathione S-transferase was the only shared resistance variant for both phenotypes. There were more leucine rich-repeat containing transcripts found for lesion resistance, while different candidate resistance transcripts such as a VQ motif-containing protein and a myo-inositol oxygenase were found for nodal resistance. This study demonstrated the robustness of combining GWAS and RNA-Seq for identifying white mold resistance in pea, and results suggest different genetics underlying lesion and nodal resistance. © 2018 The Authors.

In the discrete space, this is similar to extracting the text chain 'hit, hot, dot, dog' from a paragraph. The first and last words have nothing in common, yet they are connected by a chain of words with a small mutual difference. Time series chains can capture the evolution of systems, and help predict the future. As such, they potentially have implications for prognostics.

Nevertheless, the state-of-theart motif discovery tools still require the user to provide the motif length. Yet, in at least some cases, the choice of motif length is critical and unforgiving. Unfortunately, the obvious brute-force solution, which tests all lengths within a given range, is computationally untenable. In this work, we introduce VALMOD, an exact and scalable motif discovery algorithm that efficiently finds all motifs in a given range of lengths. We evaluate our approach with five diverse real datasets, and demonstrate that it is up to 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art. Our results also show that removing the unrealistic assumption that the user knows the correct length, can often produce more intuitive and actionable results, which could have been missed otherwise. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Since their introduction over a decade ago, time series motifs have become a fundamental tool for time series analytics, finding diverse uses in dozens of domains. In this work we introduce Time Series Chains, which are related to, but distinct from, time series motifs. Informally, time series chains are a temporally ordered set of subsequence patterns, such that each pattern is similar to the pattern that preceded it, but the first and last patterns are arbitrarily dissimilar. In the discrete space, this is similar to extracting the text chain “hit, hot, dot, dog” from a paragraph. The first and last words have nothing in common, yet they are connected by a chain of words with a small mutual difference. Time Series Chains can capture the evolution of systems, and help predict the future. As such, they potentially have implications for prognostics. In this work, we introduce a robust definition of time series chains, and a scalable algorithm that allows us to discover them in massive datasets. © 2018 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Dengue is an arbovirus that has spread throughout different, especially tropical and subtropical, regions of the world. This disease affects humans through mosquito bites. The occurrence of dengue epidemics has increased alarmingly over the last three decades. To detect a pattern regarding the dispersal process of dengue, this research presents a computational model based on three pillars: complex networks, time-varying graphing (TVG), and time-series synchronisation. To establish the synchronisation networks, the Motif-Synchronisation method with TVG was applied to a time series analysis of georeferenced dengue incidence data from the municipalities of Bahia from 2001 to 2016. After applying the model presented in this work, the dispersal behaviour patterns of these epidemics were found amongst the municipalities within Bahia, when synchronised, in epidemic moments. The results indicate that the incidence of dengue is not directly related to the distance between municipalities; rather, a time relation exists regarding the development of the vector and its capacity to transmit disease. The purpose of this model is to contribute to public disease interventions by providing early information. © 2018},

The networked epileptic brain has already been studied through various neuroimaging modalities based on estimates of functional connectivity. Here, we suggest that additional insights to epileptogenesis can be gained with an appropriate description on the network (re)organization dynamics as these are reflected in surface EEG measurements. Our approach commences with a pattern analytic step that turns a time series of connectivity patterns into a symbolic time series. The condensed dynamics are then analyzed by means of Markov chain modeling and a motif detection algorithm. Both descriptions yield novel dynamic characteristics that can capture the progression towards an epileptic crisis. Conceptually, our work adds to the emerging field of “chronnectomics”. Empirically, the obtained results based on actual experimental data are very encouraging and deserve further consideration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Sensor networks deployed in lakes and reservoirs, when combined with simulation models and expert knowledge from the global community, are creating deeper understanding of the ecological dynamics of lakes. However, the amount of data and the complex patterns in the data demand substantial compute resources and efficient data mining algorithms, both of which are beyond the realm of traditional limnological research. This paper uniquely adapts methods from computer science for application to data intensive ecological questions, in order to provide ecologists with approachable methodology to facilitate knowledge discovery in lake ecology. We apply a state-of-the-art time series mining technique based on symbolic representation (SAX) to high-frequency time series of phycocyanin (PHYCO) and chlorophyll (CHLORO) fluorescence, both of which are indicators of algal biomass in lakes, as well as model predictions of algal biomass (MODEL). We use data mining techniques to demonstrate that MODEL predicts PHYCO better than it predicts CHLORO. All time series have high redundancy, resulting in a relatively small subset of unique patterns. However, MODEL is much less complex than either PHYCO or CHLORO and fails to reproduce high biomass periods indicative of algal blooms. We develop a set of tools in R to enable motif discovery and anomaly detection within a single lake time series, and relationship study among multiple lake time series through distance metrics, clustering and classification. Furthermore, to improve computation times, we provision web services to launch R tools remotely on high performance computing (HPC) resources. Comprehensive experimental results on observational and simulated lake data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent studies show that using grammar compression algorithms to find repeating patterns from the symbolized time series holds promise in discovering approximate motifs with variable length. However, grammar compression algorithms are traditionally designed for string compression. Therefore, existing work on grammar induction has not fully utilized much available information that can be used to enhance the performance of the algorithms. In this work, an iterative framework based on grammar induction is proposed. In each iteration, a revision operator called Noise Reduction Operator is applied to revise the symbolized time series string based on the rules returned from a base grammar induction algorithm. In our experiments, we show that the proposed work can find motifs of the same quality, with much faster running time compared to the state-of-the-art variable-length exact motif discovery algorithm in real world time series data. © 2016 IEEE.},

Sequitur is known as a grammar compression algorithm that is able to have enough identification not just common subsequences but also identify the hierarchical structure in data. As GrammarViz, our method is also based on the Sequitur algorithm, but for another purpose: a preprocessing step for finding motif in time series. The experimental results prove that our method can help to estimate very fast the length of 1-motif for some TSMD algorithms, such as Random Projection. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.},

	abstract = {Motivation A common class of behaviour encountered in the biological sciences involves branching and recombination. During branching, a statistical process bifurcates resulting in two or more potentially correlated processes that may undergo further branching; the contrary is true during recombination, where two or more statistical processes converge. A key objective is to identify the time of this bifurcation (branch or recombination time) from time series measurements, e.g. by comparing a control time series with perturbed time series. Gaussian processes (GPs) represent an ideal framework for such analysis, allowing for nonlinear regression that includes a rigorous treatment of uncertainty. Currently, however, GP models only exist for two-branch systems. Here, we highlight how arbitrarily complex branching processes can be built using the correct composition of covariance functions within a GP framework, thus outlining a general framework for the treatment of branching and recombination in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian processes (B-RGPs). Results We first benchmark the performance of B-RGPs compared to a variety of existing regression approaches, and demonstrate robustness to model misspecification. B-RGPs are then used to investigate the branching patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression following inoculation with the hemibotrophic bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, and a disarmed mutant strain, hrpA. By grouping genes according to the number of branches, we could naturally separate out genes involved in basal immune response from those subverted by the virulent strain, and show enrichment for targets of pathogen protein effectors. Finally, we identify two early branching genes WRKY11 and WRKY17, and show that genes that branched at similar times to WRKY11/17 were enriched for W-box binding motifs, and overrepresented for genes differentially expressed in WRKY11/17 knockouts, suggesting that branch time could be used for identifying direct and indirect binding targets of key transcription factors.

	abstract = {Recent IoT-based applications generate time-series in a streaming fashion, and they often require techniques that enable environmental monitoring and event detection from generated time-series. Discovering a range motif, which is a subsequence that repetitively appears the most in a time-series, is a promising approach for satisfying such a requirement. This paper tackles the problem of monitoring a range motif of a streaming time-series under a count-based sliding-window setting. Whenever a window slides, a new subsequence is generated and the oldest subsequence is removed. A straightforward solution for monitoring a range motif is to scan all subsequences in the window while computing their occurring counts measured by a similarity function. Because the main bottleneck is similarity computation, this solution is not efficient. We therefore propose an efficient algorithm, namely SRMM. SRMM is simple and its time complexity basically depends only on the occurring counts of the removed and generated subsequences. Our experiments using four real datasets demonstrate that SRMM scales well and shows better performance than a baseline. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Proper expression of the genes plays a vital role in the function of an organism. Recent advancements in DNA microarray technology allow for monitoring the expression level of thousands of genes. One of the important tasks in this context is to understand the underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Recently, researchers have focused on identifying local DNA elements, or motifs to infer the relation between the expression and the nucleotide sequence of the gene. This study proposes a novel data adaptive representation approach for supervised learning to predict the response associated with the biological sequences. Biological sequences such as DNA and protein are a class of categorical sequences. In machine learning, categorical sequences are generally mapped to a lower dimensional representation for learning tasks to avoid problems with high dimensionality. The proposed method, namely SW-RF (sliding window-random forest), is a feature-based approach requiring two main steps to learn a representation for categorical sequences. In the first step, each sequence is represented by overlapping subsequences of constant length. Then a tree-based learner on this representation is trained to obtain a bag-of-words like representation which is the frequency of subsequences on the terminal nodes of the tree for each sequence. After representation learning, any classifier can be trained on the learned representation. A lasso logistic regression is trained on the learned representation to facilitate the identification of important patterns for the classification task. Our experiments show that proposed approach provides significantly better results in terms of accuracy on both synthetic data and DNA promoter sequence data. Moreover, a common problem for microarray datasets, namely missing values, is handled efficiently by the tree learners in SW-RF. Although the focus of this paper is on biological sequences, SW-RF is flexible in handling any categorical sequence data from different applications. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Inferred European Holocene population size exhibits large fluctuations, particularly around the onset of farming. We attempt to find explanations for these fluctuations by employing the concept of cycling, especially that of the Adaptive Cycle. We base our analysis on chronologically and chorologically highly resolved ceramic and site data from the Linear Pottery culture (Germ. Linearbandkermik) of the early Neolithic of southwestern Central Europe. Typological seriation with dendrochronological anchor dates provides the age model for these data. Ceramic motifs are analysed with respect to the temporally changing diversity in decoration. The temporal sequence of major decoration motifs is interpreted as an indicator of social diversity: when stylistic diversity is low, social diversity is low and vice versa. The sequence of secondary decoration motifs is interpreted in terms of individual lineage emphasis: when this diversity is low, there is strong emphasis on individual lineage and vice versa. The diversity time series are complemented by a relative population size indicator derived from the count of occupational features. Diversity and population size share a shape that is typical for (part of) an Adaptive Cycle, and they differ in their positioning on the time axis — they are time-lagged. By relating the different curves to the (metaphorical) stages of the Adaptive Cycle, we find that these cycles progress at non-identical speed in different aspects of a social system. By relating the social dynamics to well-dated and highly resolved climate fluctuation records, we find evidence that severe climate excursions shaped the location of tipping points in the social system and that these social tipping points precede inferred population decline by several generations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA},

	abstract = {In Hindustani classical music, melodic phrases are identified not only by the stable notes at precise pitch intervals but also by the shapes of the continuous transient pitch segments connecting these. Time-series matching via subsequence dynamic time warping (DTW) facilitates the equal contribution of stable notes and transients to the computation of similarity between pitch contour segments corresponding to melodic phrases. In the interest of reducing computational complexity it is advantageous to replace time-series DTW with low-dimensional string matching provided a principled approach to the time-series to symbolic string conversion is available. While the stable notes easily lend themselves to quantization, we address the compact representation of the transient pitch segments in this work. We analyze the design considerations at each stage: pitch curve fitting, normalization (with respect to pitch interval and duration), shape dictionary generation, inter-symbol proximity measure and string matching cost functions. A combination of domain knowledgeand data-driven optimization on a database of raga music is exploited to design the melodic representation of a raga phrase that enables a performance comparable to the time series based matching in an audio search by query task at significantly lower computational cost. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The human protein disulfide isomerase (hPDI), is an essential four-domain multifunctional enzyme. As a result of disulfide shuffling in its terminal domains, hPDI exists in two oxidation states with different conformational preferences which are important for substrate binding and functional activities. Here, we address the redox-dependent conformational dynamics of hPDI through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Collective domain motions are identified by the principal component analysis of MD trajectories and redox-dependent opening-closing structure variations are highlighted on projected free energy landscapes. Then, important structural features that exhibit considerable differences in dynamics of redox states are extracted by statistical machine learning methods. Mapping the structural variations to time series of residue interaction networks also provides a holistic representation of the dynamical redox differences. With emphasizing on persistent long-lasting interactions, an approach is proposed that compiled these time series networks to a single dynamic residue interaction network (DRIN). Differential comparison of DRIN in oxidized and reduced states reveals chains of residue interactions that represent potential allosteric paths between catalytic and ligand binding sites of hPDI. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Time series data is collected in almost every industrial field; mining knowledge from it has been attracting extensive attention in the data mining community. In this paper, we focus on temporal association rule mining from real-valued time series. Early work employs symbolization-based methods, but the symbolized representation misses out similarity of the original series, resulting in mining invalid rules. Although state-of-the-art work directly manipulates the original series, it may still find false rules due to the lack of correlation analysis. In our work, we present a hybrid approach combining the idea of direct manipulation and symbolization, which not only preserves the information about the raw data but also realizes the correlation analysis. Specifically, we leverage the similarity-preserving property of motifs, i.e. frequent occurring subsequences in time series, to partially symbolize the raw data. Then, for each rule candidate as a pair of motifs, we propose a rule searching framework to investigate the underlying relationships between them. To evaluate rule candidates, we accommodate the shape similarity by utilizing the relative information gain based on Minimum Description Length principle, and further develop a novel rule interestingness measure R-cos, which generalizes the classical measure cosine for association rules. We perform comprehensive experiments on both artificial and real world datasets, and the results show that the proposed rule searching framework and the rule interestingness measure are effective for mining valid temporal association rules from real-valued time series. © 2018 IEEE.},

In this work, we show that these efforts, which typically attempt to find motifs on all dimensions, will not produce meaningful motifs except in the most contrived situations. We explain this finding and introduce mSTAMP, an algorithm that allows meaningful discovery of multidimensional motifs. Beyond producing objectively and subjectively meaningful results, our algorithm has a host of additional advantages, including being much faster, requiring fewer parameters and supporting streaming data.

Is this work, we extend the MP algorithm to overcome both limitations. We use a recently proposed variant of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), the Prefix and Suffix Invariant DTW (PSI-DTW) distance. The PSI-DTW allows invariance to warp and spurious endpoints caused by segmenting subsequences and has a side-effect of supporting the match of subsequences with different lengths. Besides, we propose a suite of simple methods to speed up the MP calculation, making it more than one order of magnitude faster than a straightforward implementation and providing an anytime feature. We show that using PSI-DTW avoids false positives and false dismissals commonly observed by applying ED, improving the time series motifs and discords discovery in several application domains. © 2018 IEEE.},

Two-dimensional shapes can be converted to time series and the problem of discovering motifs in shape time series can be solved by exploiting some appropriate techniques from time series motif discovery. However, so far there exists one method proposed by Xi et al. which uses Euclidean distance to deal with this problem. As for shape data, Dynamic TimeWarping (DTW) distance is more suitable and brings out more accurate results than Euclidean distance in similarity matching. Nevertheless, there are two difficulties with DTW distance in image matching: DTWdistance incurs high computational complexity and image matching requires that the distance measure must be invariant to rotation. In this work, we propose a fast method for discovering shape motifs in a database of shapes using rotation invariant DTW distance. Our method is not based on Random Projection algorithm but employs a new approach for motif-discovery: clustering-based.

	abstract = {The last decade has seen a flurry of research on all-pairs-similarity-search (or similarity joins) for text, DNA and a handful of other datatypes, and these systems have been applied to many diverse data mining problems. However, there has been surprisingly little progress made on similarity joins for time series subsequences. The lack of progress probably stems from the daunting nature of the problem. For even modest sized datasets the obvious nested-loop algorithm can take months, and the typical speed-up techniques in this domain (i.e., indexing, lower-bounding, triangular-inequality pruning and early abandoning) at best produce only one or two orders of magnitude speedup. In this work we introduce a novel scalable algorithm for time series subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search. For exceptionally large datasets, the algorithm can be trivially cast as an anytime algorithm and produce high-quality approximate solutions in reasonable time and/or be accelerated by a trivial porting to a GPU framework. The exact similarity join algorithm computes the answer to the time series motif and time series discord problem as a side-effect, and our algorithm incidentally provides the fastest known algorithm for both these extensively-studied problems. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas for many time series data mining problems, including motif discovery, novelty discovery, shapelet discovery, semantic segmentation, density estimation, and contrast set mining. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our ideas on domains as diverse as seismology, music processing, bioinformatics, human activity monitoring, electrical power-demand monitoring and medicine. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In recent years, finding repetitive similar patterns in time series has become a popular problem. These patterns are called time series motifs. Recent studies show that using grammar compression algorithms to find repeating patterns from the symbolized time series holds promise in discovering approximate motifs with variable length. However, grammar compression algorithms are traditionally designed for string compression. Therefore, existing work on grammar induction has not fully utilized much available information that can be used to enhance the performance of the algorithms. In this work, an iterative framework based on grammar induction is proposed. In each iteration, a revision operator called Noise Reduction Operator is applied to revise the symbolized time series string based on the rules returned from a base grammar induction algorithm. In our experiments, we show that the proposed work can find motifs of the same quality, with much faster running time compared to the state-of-the-art variable-length exact motif discovery algorithm in real world time series data. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Detecting repeated variable-length patterns, also called variable-length motifs, has received a great amount of attention in recent years. Current state-of-the-art algorithm utilizes fixed-length motif discovery algorithm as a subroutine to enumerate variable-length motifs. As a result, it may take hours or days to execute when enumeration range is large. In this work, we introduce an approximate algorithm called HierarchIcal based Motif Enumeration (HIME) to detect variable-length motifs with a large enumeration range in million-scale time series. We show in the experiments that the scalability of the proposed algorithm is significantly better than that of the state-of-theart algorithm. Moreover, the motif length range detected by HIME is considerably larger than previous sequence-matching based approximate variable-length motif discovery approach. We demonstrate that HIME can efficiently detect meaningful variable-length motifs in long, real world time series. © 2017 IEEE.},

The technique combines and modifies a motif discovery algorithm with a scheduling algorithm based on mixed-integer programming.

	abstract = {Background: The antibiotic methylenomycin A is produced naturally by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), a model organism for streptomycetes. This compound is of particular interest to synthetic biologists because all of the associated biosynthetic, regulatory and resistance genes are located on a single cluster on the SCP1 plasmid, making the entire module easily transferable between different bacterial strains. Understanding further the regulation and biosynthesis of the methylenomycin producing gene cluster could assist in the identification of motifs that can be exploited in synthetic regulatory systems for the rational engineering of novel natural products and antibiotics. Results: We identify and validate a plausible architecture for the regulatory system controlling methylenomycin production in S. coelicolor using mathematical modeling approaches. Model selection via an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach identifies three candidate model architectures that are most likely to produce the available experimental data, from a set of 48 possible candidates. Subsequent global optimization of the parameters of these model architectures identifies a single model that most accurately reproduces the dynamical response of the system, as captured by time series data on methylenomycin production. Further analyses of variants of this model architecture that capture the effects of gene knockouts also reproduce qualitative experimental results observed in mutant S. coelicolor strains. Conclusions: The mechanistic mathematical model developed in this study recapitulates current biological knowledge of the regulation and biosynthesis of the methylenomycin producing gene cluster, and can be used in future studies to make testable predictions and formulate experiments to further improve our understanding of this complex regulatory system. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Evolution has led to the development of biological networks that are shaped by environmental signals. Elucidating, understanding and then reconstructing important network motifs is one of the principal aims of Systems & Synthetic Biology. Consequently, previous research has focused on finding optimal network structures and reaction rates that respond to pulses or produce stable oscillations. In this work we present a generalised in silico evolutionary algorithm that simultaneously finds network structures and reaction rates (genotypes) that can satisfy multiple defined objectives (phenotypes). Results: The key step to our approach is to translate a schema/binary-based description of biological networks into systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The ODEs can then be solved numerically to provide dynamic information about an evolved networks functionality. Initially we benchmark algorithm performance by finding optimal networks that can recapitulate concentration time-series data and perform parameter optimisation on oscillatory dynamics of the Repressilator. We go on to show the utility of our algorithm by finding new designs for robust synthetic oscillators, and by performing multi-objective optimisation to find a set of oscillators and feed-forward loops that are optimal at balancing different system properties. In sum, our results not only confirm and build on previous observations but we also provide new designs of synthetic oscillators for experimental construction. Conclusions: In this work we have presented and tested an evolutionary algorithm that can design a biological network to produce desired output. Given that previous designs of synthetic networks have been limited to subregions of network- and parameter-space, the use of our evolutionary optimisation algorithm will enable Synthetic Biologists to construct new systems with the potential to display a wider range of complex responses. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Multiple physiological systems interact throughout the development of a complex disease. Knowledge of the dynamics and connectivity of interactions across physiological systems could facilitate the prevention or mitigation of organ damage underlying complex diseases, many of which are currently refractory to available therapeutics (e.g., hypertension). We studied the regulatory interactions operating within and across organs throughout disease development by integrating in vivo analysis of gene expression dynamics with a reverse engineering approach to infer data-driven dynamic network models of multi-organ gene regulatory influences. We obtained experimental data on the expression of 22 genes across five organs, over a time span that encompassed the development of autonomic nervous system dysfunction and hypertension. We pursued a unique approach for identification of continuous-time models that jointly described the dynamics and structure of multi-organ networks by estimating a sparse subset of ∼12,000 possible gene regulatory interactions. Our analyses revealed that an autonomic dysfunction-specific multi-organ sequence of gene expression activation patterns was associated with a distinct gene regulatory network. We analyzed the model structures for adaptation motifs, and identified disease-specific network motifs involving genes that exhibited aberrant temporal dynamics. Bioinformatic analyses identified disease-specific single nucleotide variants within or near transcription factor binding sites upstream of key genes implicated in maintaining physiological homeostasis. Our approach illustrates a novel framework for investigating the pathogenesis through model-based analysis of multi-organ system dynamics and network properties. Our results yielded novel candidate molecular targets driving the development of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and immune dysfunction. © 2017 Anderson et al.},

Worldwide, humankind keeps an enormous number of domesticated birds (e.g. chickens) for their eggs and their meat, providing rich sources of low-fat protein. However, around the world, there have been growing concerns about the quality of life for the livestock in poultry farms; and increasingly vocal demands for improved standards of animal welfare. Recent advances in sensing technologies and machine learning allow the possibility of automatically assessing the health of some individual birds, and employing the lessons learned to improve the welfare for all birds. This task superficially appears to be easy, given the dramatic progress in recent years in classifying human behaviors, and given that human behaviors are presumably more complex. However, as we shall demonstrate, classifying chicken behaviors poses several unique challenges, chief among which is creating a generalizable 'dictionary' of behaviors from sparse and noisy data. In this work we introduce a novel time series dictionary learning algorithm that can robustly learn from weakly labeled data sources. © 2018 IEEE.},

Another problem strongly related with TSMD is Word Segmentation. This problem has received much attention from the community that studies early language acquisition in babies and toddlers. The development of biologically plausible models for word segmentation could greatly advance this field. Therefore, in this article, we propose the Variable Input Length Map (VILMAP) for Motif Discovery and Word Segmentation. The model is based on the Self-Organizing Maps and can identify Motifs with different lengths in time series. In our experiments, we show that VILMAP presents good results in finding Motifs in a standard Motif discovery dataset and can avoid catastrophic forgetting when trained with datasets with increasing values of input size. We also show that VILMAP achieves results similar or superior to other methods in the literature developed for the task of word segmentation. © 2018 IEEE.},

Here the extraction of recurring patterns in sequential and textual data is one of the main computational bottlenecks. For this, we address the problem of extracting maximal patterns with at most k don't care symbols and at least q occurrences, according to a maximality notion we define. We apply the motif trie to this problem, also showing how to build it efficiently. As a result, we give the first algorithm that attains a stronger notion of output-sensitivity, where the cost for an input sequence of n symbols is proportional to the actual number of occurrences of each pattern, which is at most n (much smaller in practice). This avoids the best-known cost of O(nc) per pattern, for constant c>1, which is otherwise impractical for massive sequences with large n. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The increasing number of wearable sensors for monitoring of various vital parameters such as blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, or heart rate (HR), has opened up an unprecedented opportunity for personalized real-time monitoring and prediction of critical health conditions of patients. This, however, also poses the dual challenges of identifying clinically relevant information from vast volumes of sensor time-series data and of storing and communicating it to health-care providers especially in the context of rural areas of developing regions where communication bandwidth may be limited. One approach to address these challenges is data summarization, but the danger of losing clinically useful information makes it less appealing to medical practitioners. To overcome this, we develop a data summarization technique called RASPRO (Rapid Active Summarization for effective PROgnosis), which transforms raw sensor time-series data into a series of low bandwidth, medically interpretable symbols, called “motifs”, which measure criticality and preserve clinical effectiveness benefits for patients. We evaluate the predictive power and bandwidth requirements of RASPRO on more than 16,000 minutes of patient monitoring data from a widely used open source challenge dataset. We find that RASPRO motifs have much higher clinical efficacy and efficiency (20 − 90% improvement in F1 score over bandwidths ranging from 0.2–0.75 bits/unit-time) in predicting an acute hypotensive episode (AHE) compared to Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) which is a state-of-the-art data reduction and symbolic representation method. Furthermore, the RASPRO motifs typically perform as well or much better than the original raw data time-series, but with up to 15-fold reduction in transmission/storage bandwidth thereby suggesting that less is better. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Human forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ cluster of differentiation (CD)25+CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a type of T cell that express CD4, CD25 and FOXP3, which are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis. The present study aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying Treg function. The GSE11292 dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which included data from Treg cells at 19 time points (0-360 min) with an equal interval of 20 min, and corresponding repeated samples. However, data for Treg cells at time point 120 min were missing. Using the Mfuzz package, the key genes were identified by clustering analysis. Subsequently, regulatory networks and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed and merged into integrated networks using Cytoscape software. Using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discover software, enrichment analyses were performed for the genes involved in the PPI networks. Cluster 1 (including 292 genes), cluster 2 (including 111 genes), cluster 3 (including 194 genes) and cluster 4 (including 103 genes) were obtained from the clustering analysis. GAPDH (degree, 40) in cluster 1, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) (degree, 10) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A) (degree, 9) in cluster 3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (degree, 26) and interleukin 2 (IL2) (degree, 22) in cluster 4 had higher degrees in the PPI networks. In addition, it was indicated that several genes may have a role in Treg function by targeting other genes [e.g. microRNA (miR)-146b-3p→TNF, miR-146b-5p→TNF, miR-142-5p→TNF and tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28)→GAPDH]. Enrichment analyses indicated that IL2 and TNF were enriched in the immune response and T cell receptor signaling pathway. In conclusion, GAPDH targeted by TRIM28, TNF targeted by miR-146b-3p, miR-146b-5p and miR-142-5p, in addition to JAK2, IL2, and STAT5A may serve important roles in Treg function.},

	abstract = {Jasmonic acid (JA) is a critical hormonal regulator of plant growth and defense. To advance our understanding of the architecture and dynamic regulation of the JA gene regulatory network, we performed a high-resolution RNA-seq time series of methyl JA-treated Arabidopsis thaliana at 15 time points over a 16-h period. Computational analysis showed that methyl JA (MeJA) induces a burst of transcriptional activity, generating diverse expression patterns over time that partition into distinct sectors of the JA response targeting specific biological processes. The presence of transcription factor (TF) DNA binding motifs correlated with specific TF activity during temporal MeJA-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Insight into the underlying dynamic transcriptional regulation mechanisms was captured in a chronological model of the JA gene regulatory network. Several TFs, including MYB59 and bHLH27, were uncovered as early network components with a role in pathogen and insect resistance. Analysis of subnetworks surrounding the TFs ORA47, RAP2.6L, MYB59, and ANAC055, using transcriptome profiling of overexpressors and mutants, provided insights into their regulatory role in defined modules of the JA network. Collectively, our work illuminates the complexity of the JA gene regulatory network, pinpoints and validates previously unknown regulators, and provides a valuable resource for functional studies on JA signaling components in plant defense and development. © 2017 ASPB.},

Nodes in a graph representing a social network take turns generating words, leading to a symbolic time series associated with each node. Information propagates over the graph via a quoting mechanism, where nodes randomly copy short segments of text from each other. We characterize information flows from these text via information-theoretic estimators, and we derive analytic relationships between model parameters and the values of these estimators. We explore and validate the model with simulations on small network motifs and larger random graphs. Tractable models such as ours that generate symbolic data while controlling the information flow allow us to test and compare measures of information flow applicable to real social media data. In particular, by choosing different network structures, we can develop test scenarios to determine whether or not measures of information flow can distinguish between true and spurious interactions, and how topological network properties relate to information flow. © 2018 Author(s).},

However these algorithms do not perform well in practice. The algorithms that are employed in practice have a worst case quadratic run time. One of the best performing algorithms for the CPP is MK (originally designed for solving the time series motif finding problem). In this paper we present an elegant exact algorithm called MPR for the CPP that performs better than MK. Also, we present approximation algorithms for the CPP that are faster than MK by up to a factor of more than 40, while maintaining a very good accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Time series motifs are approximately repeated subsequences found within a longer time series. They have been in the literature since 2002, but recently they have begun to receive significant attention in research and industrial communities. This is perhaps due to the growing realization that they implicitly offer solutions to a host of time series problems, including rule discovery, anomaly detection, density estimation, semantic segmentation, summarization, etc. Recent work has improved the scalability so exact motifs can be computed on datasets with up to a million data points in tenable time. However, in some domains, for example seismology or climatology, there is an immediate need to address even larger datasets. In this work, we demonstrate that a combination of a novel algorithm and a high-performance GPU allows us to significantly improve the scalability of motif discovery. We demonstrate the scalability of our ideas by finding the full set of exact motifs on a dataset with one hundred and forty-three million subsequences, which is by far the largest dataset ever mined for time series motifs/joins; it requires ten quadrillion pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm can produce actionable insights into seismology and ethology. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The problem of time series motif discovery has attracted a lot of attention and is useful in many real-world applications. However, most of the proposed methods so far use Euclidean distance to deal with this problem. There has been one proposed method, called MDTW_WedgeTree, for time series motif discovery under DTW distance. But this method aims to deal with the case in which motif is the time series in a time series database which has the highest count of its similar time series within a range r. To adapt the above-mentioned method to the case in which motifs are frequently occurring subsequences of a longer time series, we modify MDTW_WedgeTree to a new algorithm for discovering “subsequence” motifs in time series under DTW. The proposed method consists of a segmentation method to divide the time series into motif candidates and a BIRCH-based clustering which can efficiently cluster motif candidate subsequences under DTW distance. Experimental results showed that our proposed method for discovering “subsequence” motifs performs very efficiently on large time series datasets while brings out high accuracy. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

A bottleneck in dealing with such datasets lies in developing effective algorithms for extracting useful information from them. Algorithms for finding patterns in biological data pave the way for extracting crucial information from voluminous datasets. In this paper we focus on a fundamental pattern, namely, the closest l-mers. Given a set of m biological strings S1, S2,..., Sm and an integer l, the problem of interest is that of finding an l-mer from each string such that the distance among them is the least. I.e., we want to find m l-mers X1, X2,..., Xm such that Xi is an l-mer in Si (for 1 ≤ i ≤ m) and the Hamming distance among these m l-mers is the least (from among all such possible l-mers). This problem has many applications. An application of great importance is motif search. Algorithms for finding the closest l-mers have been used in solving the (l, d)-motif search problem (see e.g., [1], [2]). In this paper novel exact and approximate algorithms are proposed for this problem for the special case of m = 3. We consider the Euclidean distance metric if the sequences contain real numbers. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Finding and extracting standard patterns in energy time series is very important to many real-world applications. Hence, there exists a multitude of pattern recognition algorithms with a majority of them being supervised ones. The advantage of supervision is that it can easily be checked if the algorithm is performing well or not. However, if no labels are available, an unsupervised pattern search is necessary. This search is faced with the challenge of how to measure success. Thus the question arises, when is a found pattern – for example a motif or a mean cluster curve – really describing the standard behaviour of a process and not just some kind of irrelevant behaviour? The present paper introduces a new method to assess two methods – namely clustering and motif discovery – in their quest to find standard profiles in energy time series data from industrial processes. Although both methods share the same aim, the results are incongruent. This finding has profound implications for real-world applications. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Time series motif discovery is an important primitive for time series analytics, and is used in domains as diverse as neuroscience, music and sports analytics. In recent years, algorithmic advances (coupled with hardware improvements) have greatly expanded the purview of motif discovery. Nevertheless, we argue that there is an insatiable need for further scalability. This is because more than most types of analytics, motif discovery benefits from interactivity. The two state-of-the-art algorithms to find motifs are STOMP, which requires O(n2) time, and STAMP, which, despite being an O(logn) factor slower, is the preferred solution for most applications, as it is a fast converging anytime algorithm. In favorable scenarios STAMP needs only to be run to a small fraction of completion to provide a very accurate approximation of the top-k motifs. In this work we introduce SCRIMP++, an O(n2) time algorithm that is also an anytime algorithm, combining the best features of STOMP and STAMP. As we shall show, SCRIMP++ maintains all the desirable properties of the original algorithms, but converges much faster, in almost all scenarios producing the correct output after spending a tiny fraction of the full computation time. We argue that for many end-users, this allows motif discovery to be performed in interactive sessions. Moreover, this interactivity can be game changing in terms of the analytics that can be performed. © 2018 IEEE.},

Here motifs are sub-graphs that occur more frequently than would be explained by random connections. Graphs can be used to model internal network structures of human groups, or links between groups, with group dynamics being governed by these structures. Graphs can also model behavior in engineered systems, and internal network structures can significantly affect dynamic behavior. A graph may only be partially visible (such as in hostile or coalition environments), however detectable network motifs may in some cases be reflective of the entire graph. We outline a research plan and describe basic network motifs and their properties, along with current analytic techniques for static and dynamic settings. We offer suggestions as to how network motif techniques can be applied to intra- or inter- group behavior, for example to detect whether multiple groups behave as a co-operative alliance, or whether coalition networks inter-operate in positive ways. As an example, we examine a complex time-series graph dataset relevant to coalition focused aspects of the class of networks under study, specifically related to the social network resulting from the authorship of academic papers within a coalition. We provide details of the basic analysis of this network over time and outline how this can be used as one of the datasets for our planned network motif research activities, especially with regards to the temporal and evolutionary aspects. © 2018 SPIE.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown to be a useful modality with which user emotional states can be measured and monitored, particularly primitives such as valence and arousal. In this paper, we propose the use of ordinal pattern analysis, also called motifs, for improved EEG-based emotion recognition. Motifs capture recurring structures in time series and are inherently robust to noise, thus are well suited for the task at hand. Several connectivity, asymmetry, and graph-theoretic features are proposed and extracted from the motifs to be used for affective state recognition. Experiments with a widely used public database are conducted, and results show the proposed features outperforming benchmark spectrum-based features, as well as other more recent nonmotif-based graph-theoretic features and amplitude modulation-based connectivity/asymmetry measures. Feature and score-level fusion suggest complementarity between the proposed and benchmark spectrum-based measures. When combined, the fused models can provide up to 9% improvement relative to benchmark features alone and up to 16% to nonmotif-based graph-theoretic features. © 2019 Abhishek Tiwari and Tiago H.

	abstract = {Otitis media (OM) is the most common infectious disease of children under six, causing more antibiotic prescriptions and surgical procedures than any other pediatric condition. By screening a bacteriophage (phage) library genetically engineered to express random peptides on their surfaces, we discovered unique peptides that actively transport phage particles across the intact tympanic membrane (TM) and into the middle ear (ME). Herein our goals were to characterize the physiochemical peptide features that may underlie trans-TM phage transport; assess morphological and functional effects of phage peptides on the ME and inner ear (IE); and determine whether peptide-bearing phage transmigrate from the ME into the IE. Incubation of five peptide-bearing phage on the TM for over 4hrs resulted in demonstrably superior transport of one peptide, in level and in exponential increase over time. This suggests a preferred peptide motif for TM active transport. Functional and structural comparisons revealed unique features of this peptide: These include a central lysine residue, isoelectric point of 0.0 at physiological pH and a hydrophobic C-terminus. When the optimal peptide was applied to the TM independent of phage, similar transport was observed, indicating that integration into phage is not required. When 109 particles of the four different trans-TM phage were applied directly into the ME, no morphological effects were detected in the ME or IE when compared to saline or wild-type (WT) phage controls. Comparable, reversible hearing loss was observed for saline controls, WT phage and trans- TM peptide phage, suggesting a mild conductive hearing loss due to ME fluid. Perilymph titers after ME incubation established that few copies of trans-TM peptide phage crossed into the IE. The results suggest that, within the parameters tested, trans-TM peptides are safe and could be used as potential agents for noninvasive delivery of drugs, particles and gene therapy vectors to the ME.},

To successfully deploy SoS's run-time quality assurance, online reliability time series prediction, which aims to predict the reliability in near future for a service-oriented SoS,arises as a grand challenge in SoS research. In this paper, we tackle the prediction challenge by exploiting two novel prediction models.

The discovered motifs can be ranked by different metrics such as frequency or similarity, and can benefit a wide variety of real-world applications. We demonstrate that our approach can discover motifs in time series with over one hundred million points in just minutes, which is significantly faster than the fastest existing algorithm to date.

	abstract = {Raga is a quintessential component of Indian classical music. Ragas are primarily characterised by melodic timefrequency (T-F) motifs. There have been several efforts made to determine the identity of a raga, yet the techniques work only on subset(s) of ragas, or perform poorly in terms of scalability. In this paper, we propose a raga identification method for Carnatic music using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). LSH is a technique that can match similar time series into the same bucket. LSH is close to how humans perceive ragas, in that it hashes T-F motifs to a smaller subset of ragas. Experiments were performed on a standard dataset consisting of 100 concerts, each with 8-10 ragas, leading to 927 items and 182 ragas. 3000 raga queries on this database achieved an accuracy of 70%. Most importantly LSH does not suffer from scalability issues of earlier approaches. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Visibility algorithms are a family of geometric and ordering criteria by which a real-valued time series of N data is mapped into a graph of N nodes. This graph has been shown to often inherit in its topology nontrivial properties of the series structure, and can thus be seen as a combinatorial representation of a dynamical system. Here we explore in some detail the relation between visibility graphs and symbolic dynamics. To do that, we consider the degree sequence of horizontal visibility graphs generated by the one-parameter logistic map, for a range of values of the parameter for which the map shows chaotic behaviour. Numerically, we observe that in the chaotic region the block entropies of these sequences systematically converge to the Lyapunov exponent of the time series. Hence, Pesin's identity suggests that these block entropies are converging to the Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy of the physical measure, which ultimately suggests that the algorithm is implicitly and adaptively constructing phase space partitions which might have the generating property. To give analytical insight, we explore the relation k(x),x∈[0,1] that, for a given datum with value x, assigns in graph space a node with degree k. In the case of the out-degree sequence, such relation is indeed a piece-wise constant function. By making use of explicit methods and tools from symbolic dynamics we are able to analytically show that the algorithm indeed performs an effective partition of the phase space and that such partition is naturally expressed as a countable union of subintervals, where the endpoints of each subinterval are related to the fixed point structure of the iterates of the map and the subinterval enumeration is associated with particular ordering structures that we called motifs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To date, it remains unclear how anthropogenic perturbations influence the dynamics of microbial communities, what general patterns arise in response to disturbance, and whether it is possible to predict them. Here, we suggest the use of microbial mats as a model of study to reveal patterns that can illuminate the ecological processes underlying microbial dynamics in response to stress. We traced the responses to anthropogenic perturbation caused by water depletion in microbial mats from Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB), Mexico, by using a time-series spatially resolved analysis in a novel combination of three computational approaches. First, we implemented MEBS (Multigenomic Entropy-Based Score) to evaluate the dynamics of major biogeochemical cycles across spatio-temporal scales with a single informative value. Second, we used robust Time Series-Ecological Networks (TS-ENs) to evaluate the total percentage of interactions at different taxonomic levels. Lastly, we utilized network motifs to characterize specific interaction patterns. Our results indicate that microbial mats from CCB contain an enormous taxonomic diversity with at least 100 phyla, mainly represented by members of the rare biosphere (RB). Statistical ecological analyses point out a clear involvement of anaerobic guilds related to sulfur and methane cycles during wet versus dry conditions, where we find an increase in fungi, photosynthetic, and halotolerant taxa. TS-ENs indicate that in wet conditions, there was an equilibrium between cooperation and competition (positive and negative relationships, respectively), while under dry conditions there is an over-representation of negative relationships. Furthermore, most of the keystone taxa of the TS-ENs at family level are members of the RB and the microbial mat core highlighting their crucial role within the community. Our results indicate that microbial mats are more robust to perturbation due to redundant functions that are likely shared among community members in the highly connected TS-ENs with density values close to one (≈0.9). Finally, we provide evidence that suggests that a large taxonomic diversity where all community members interact with each other (low modularity), the presence of permanent of low-abundant taxa, and an increase in competition can be potential buffers against environmental disturbance in microbial mats. © 2018 De Anda, Zapata-Peñasco, Blaz, Poot-Hernández, Contreras-Moreira, González Tamariz, Hernández-Rosales, Eguiarte and Souza.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor in adults, highly infiltrative and difficult to cure. According to the histopathological evidence, the glioma cells are found to infiltrate into the surround normal brain tissue, along the Scherer’s structure (e.g. white matter tract and microvasculature). As a major invasion route of microenvironments, these pre-existing anatomic structures should be considered in studying infiltrative movement of glioblastoma. In our previous work, we introduced in vitro biomimetic platform as alternative model of brain-anatomical structures to study about migratory phenotypes of glioblastoma. By applying this proper biomimetic platform, we further investigated the influence of integrin, which is one of mechanoreceptors to sense mechanical cues, on phenotype of glioblastoma cells in this study. On in vitro biomimetic platform, glioblastoma cells show elongated morphology with highly aligned along the patterned direction, which is similar to that on in vivo condition. These morphological changes were gradually progressed in time-dependent manner, which might be mediated by a representative mechanoreceptor, integrin. Treatment of cell adhesive motif for integrin inhibition hinders the morphological dynamics on in vitro biomimetic platform in early time-point compared with cell proliferation cycle. Since cell adhesion mediated by mechanoreceptors is one of essential steps in migration/invasion, our results imply that effect of integrin on glioblastoma invasion is mediated by the mechanosensing process on topography and indicated by morphological changes. For further application, this quantitative analysis of glioblastoma morphology on biomimetic platform can be contributed to simple and ease investigation and effective anti-cancer drug screening. © 2017, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Time series segmentation is one of the important basic tasks in time series data mining. Indeed, it is a pre-requisite step for many other time series mining tasks such as dimension reduction, representation, classification, clustering, prediction, motif discovery and anomaly detection in time series. Since several segmentation techniques have been proposed, it is difficult to select a suitable one for a specific application if we do not know how to evaluate the performance of various segmentation methods. This paper focuses on comparing the quality of three well-known segmentation methods: Important Extreme Points, Perceptually Important Points and Polynomial Least Square Approximation by using some existing evaluation criteria for time series segmentation. However, the existing evaluation criteria required prior knowledge about the time series and their segments as external information in their criteria. Therefore, we propose one more evaluation criterion for time series segmentation. Experimental results have showed that the set of novel evaluation criteria can help to quantify segmentation results and the quality of each segmentation method depends on the characteristics of each tested dataset. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Dynamic time warping (DTW) is the main algorithms for time series alignment. However, it is unsuitable for quasi-periodic time series. In the current situation, except the recently published the shape exchange algorithm (SEA) method and its derivatives, no other technique is able to handle alignment of this type of very complex time series. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the advantages of the SEA and the DTW methods. Our main contribution consists in the elevation of the DTW power of alignment from the lowest level (Class A, non-periodic time series) to the highest level (Class C, multiple-periods time series containing different number of periods each), according to the recent classification of time series alignment methods proposed by Boucheham (Int J Mach Learn Cybern, vol. 4, no. 5, pp. 537-550, 2013). The new method (quasi-periodic dynamic time warping [QP-DTW]) was compared to both SEA and DTW methods on electrocardiogram (ECG) time series, selected from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) public database and from the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. Results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective than DTW and SEA in terms of alignment accuracy on both qualitative and quantitative levels. Therefore, QP-DTW would potentially be more suitable for many applications related to time series (e.g., data mining, pattern recognition, search/retrieval, motif discovery, classification, etc.). © 2018 KIPS.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, there is a lot of interest in assessing functional interactions between key brain regions. In this paper, Granger causality analysis (GCA) and motif structure are adopted to study directed connectivity of brain default mode networks (DMNs) in resting state. Firstly, the time series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in resting state were extracted, and the causal relationship values of the nodes representing related brain regions are analyzed in time domain to construct a default network. Then, the network structures were searched from the default networks of controls and patients to determine the fixed connection mode in the networks. The important degree of motif structures in directed connectivity of default networks was judged according to p-value and Z-score. Both node degree and average distance were used to analyze the effect degree an information transfer rate of brain regions in motifs and default networks, and efficiency of the network. Finally, activity and functional connectivity strength of the default brain regions are researched according to the change of energy distributions between the normals and the patients' brain regions. Experimental results demonstrate that, both normal subjects and stroke patients have some corresponding fixed connection mode of three nodes, and the efficiency and power spectrum of the patient's default network is somewhat lower than that of the normal person. In particular, the Right Posterior Cingulate Gyrus (PCG.R) has a larger change in functional connectivity and its activity. The research results verify the feasibility of the application of GCA and motif structure to study the functional connectivity of default networks in resting state.},

A time series motif based multi-channel synchronization method-global motif-synchronization (GMS) was proposed in this study. The simulation analysis indicated that the new algorithm was more sensitive than S-estimator based normalized weighted permutation mutual information in detection weak coupling. The algorithm was used to analyze the EEG synchronization of 26 amnesic MCI and 20 normal controls of patients with diabetes in eye-closed resting state. The wavelet enhanced independent component analysis was used to eliminate artifacts. The 32-channels EEG was divided to frontal, central, parietal, occipital, left temporal and right temporal region respectively. The independent samples t-test was performed to test differences in demographic characteristics, neuropsychology and regional synchronization values between two groups. The Pearson ' s linear correlation was used to study the associations between regional synchronization values and cognitive functions. The results showed that GMS values in each brain region of diabetes patients with MCI were lower than that of control group. Especially, the GMS values decreased significantly in central (P < 0. 01), parietal (P < 0. 05 ) and occipital (P <0. 05) regions. The MOCA scores and GMS value had a significant positive correlation in frontal (r=0. 298, P = 0.045 ), central (r = 0. 327, P= 0.026) and parietal (r = 0. 32, P = 0. 03 ) regions.

	abstract = {The classification of Phonocardiogram (PCG) time series, which is often used to indicate the heart conditions through a high-fidelity sound recording, is an important aspect in diagnosing heart-related medical conditions, particularly on canines. Both the size of the PCG time series and the irregularities featured within them render this classification process very challenging. In classifying PCG time series, motif-based approaches are considered to be very viable approach. The central idea behind motif-based approaches is to identify reoccurring sub-sequences (which are referred to as motifs) to build a classification model. However, this approach becomes challenging with large time series where the resource requirements for adopting motif-based approaches are very intensive. This paper proposes a novel two-layer PCG segmentation technique, called as PCGseg, that reduces the overall size of the time series, thus reducing the required for generating motifs. The evaluation results are encouraging and shows that the proposed approach reduces the generation time by a factor of six, without adversely affecting classification accuracy. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

The comparison includes approaches based on dynamic time warping (DTW), discretization as well as Keogh’s Matrix Profile. Every approach is exemplarily implemented in MATLAB and (if necessary) adapted to face our use cases. The focus of the assessment will be the quality of the results, the runtime and the effort of parametrization. For evaluation, time series test datasets are generated with predefined patterns based on random walks. The output patterns, identified by the different pattern discovery algorithms, are compared with the initial patterns and evaluated with respect to the Jaccard index. This leads to a quality score for every algorithm and every parametrization and the possibility to compare different algorithms as well as approaches. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this work, we interpret this signature of saccades as time-series motifs. The major issue in finding a saccade using standard motif identification methods is that saccadic signatures may be shrunk or stretched in the EOG time-series based on the saccadic duration. This shrinkage or stretching issue has been overcome in this work by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). This approach has been tested on our created EOG database and compared with existing methods of saccade detection in EOG. The proposed method shows higher accuracy as compared to existing ones. However, the execution time poses to be a limitation of the proposed method, which may be overcome by using high-speed processors and parallel computing platforms. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: With connected medical devices fast becoming ubiquitous in healthcare monitoring there is a deluge of data coming from multiple body-attached sensors. Transforming this flood of data into effective and efficient diagnosis is a major challenge. Methods: To address this challenge, we present a 3P approach: personalized patient monitoring, precision diagnostics, and preventive criticality alerts. In a collaborative work with doctors, we present the design, development, and testing of a healthcare data analytics and communication framework that we call RASPRO (Rapid Active Summarization for effective PROgnosis). The heart of RASPRO is Physician Assist Filters (PAF) that transform unwieldy multi-sensor time series data into summarized patient/disease specific trends in steps of progressive precision as demanded by the doctor for patient's personalized condition at hand and help in identifying and subsequently predictively alerting the onset of critical conditions. The output of PAFs is a clinically useful, yet extremely succinct summary of a patient's medical condition, represented as a motif, which could be sent to remote doctors even over SMS, reducing the need for data bandwidths. We evaluate the clinical validity of these techniques using SVM machine learning models measuring both the predictive power and its ability to classify disease condition. We used more than 16,000 min of patient data (N=70) from the openly available MIMIC II database for conducting these experiments. Furthermore, we also report the clinical utility of the system through doctor feedback from a large super-speciality hospital in India. Results: The results show that the RASPRO motifs perform as well as (and in many cases better than) raw time series data. In addition, we also see improvement in diagnostic performance using optimized sensor severity threshold ranges set using the personalization PAF severity quantizer. Conclusion: The RASPRO-PAF system and the associated techniques are found to be useful in many healthcare applications, especially in remote patient monitoring. The personalization, precision, and prevention PAFs presented in the paper successfully shows remarkable performance in satisfying the goals of 3Ps, thereby providing the advantages of three A's: availability, affordability, and accessibility in the global health scenario. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Biochemical networks having similar functional pathways are often correlated due to cross-talk among the homologous proteins in the different networks. Using a stochastic framework, we address the functional significance of the cross-talk between two pathways. A theoretical analysis on generic MAPK pathways reveals cross-talk is responsible for developing coordinated fluctuations between the pathways. The extent of correlation evaluated in terms of the information theoretic measure provides directionality to net information propagation. Stochastic time series suggest that the cross-talk generates synchronisation in a cell. In addition, the cross-interaction develops correlation between two different phosphorylated kinases expressed in each of the cells in a population of genetically identical cells. Depending on the number of inputs and outputs, we identify signal integration and signal bifurcation motif that arise due to inter-pathway connectivity in the composite network. Analysis using partial information decomposition, an extended formalism of multivariate information calculation, also quantifies the net synergy in the information propagation through the branched pathways. Under this formalism, signature of synergy or redundancy is observed due to the architectural difference in the branched pathways. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Similarity search is arguably the most important primitive in time series data mining. It is useful in its own right as an exploratory tool, and a subroutine in almost all higher level algorithms, such as motif discovery, anomaly detection, classification, clustering and summarization. Because of this, and the prevalence of time series data, the last decade has seen fast algorithms for time series similarity search under Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Uniform Scaling (US) distance measures. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms for US have only been demonstrated for the modest amounts of rescaling in datasets produced by human behaviors such as gestures, speech, music performance and physiological measurements such as heartbeats and respiration. As we shall show, in many industrial and commercial contexts we may encounter much greater amounts of rescaling, rendering current solutions little better than brute force search. To mitigate this problem we introduce novel lower bounds, LBnew, which, for the first time allows efficient search even in domains that exhibit more than a factor-of-two variability in scale. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with both theoretical guarantees and comprehensive experiments on real data from commercial important domains, including power consumption monitoring and ECG monitoring. The results show the application of our lower bounds significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for accelerating similarity searching of time series with more than a factor-of-two variability in scale as well as highlevel time series mining tasks. © 2018 by SIAM.},

	abstract = {Last decades witness a huge growth in medical applications, genetic analysis, and in performance of manufacturing technologies and automatised production systems. A challenging task is to identify and diagnose the behavior of such systems, which aim to produce a product with desired quality. In order to control the state of the systems, various information is gathered from different types of sensors (optical, acoustic, chemical, electric, and thermal). Time series data are a set of real-valued variables obtained chronologically. Data mining and machine learning help derive meaningful knowledge from time series. Such tasks include clustering, classification, anomaly detection and motif discovery. Motif discovery attempts to find meaningful, new, and unknown knowledge from data. Detection of motifs in a time series is beneficial for, e.g., discovery of rules or specific events in a signal. Motifs provide useful information for the user in order to model or analyze the data. Motif discovery is applied to various areas as telecommunication, medicine, web, motion-capture, and sensor networks. This contribution provides a review of the existing publications in time series motif discovery along with advantages and disadvantages of existing approaches. Moreover, the research issues and missing points in this field are highlighted. The main objective of this focus article is to serve as a glossary for researchers in this field.

	abstract = {Ramp-like structures in various atmospheric surface layer time series have been long studied, but the presence of motifs with the finer scale embedded within larger scale ramp-like structures has largely been overlooked in the reported literature. Here a novel, objective and well-adapted methodology, the ordinal pattern analysis, is adopted to study the finer-scaled motifs in atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) time series. The studies show that the motifs represented by different ordinal patterns take clustering properties and 6 dominated motifs out of the whole 24 motifs account for about 45% of the time series under particular scales, which indicates the higher contribution of motifs with the finer scale to the series. Further studies indicate that motif statistics are similar for both stable conditions and unstable conditions at larger scales, but large discrepancies are found at smaller scales, and the frequencies of motifs “1234” and/or “4321” are a bit higher under stable conditions than unstable conditions. Under stable conditions, there are great changes for the occurrence frequencies of motifs “1234” and “4321” where the occurrence frequencies of motif “1234” decrease from nearly 24% to 4.5% with the scale factor increasing, and the occurrence frequencies of motif “4321” change nonlinearly with the scale increasing. These great differences of dominated motifs change with scale can be taken as an indicator to quantify the flow structure changes under different stability conditions, and motif entropy can be defined just by only 6 dominated motifs to quantify this time-scale independent property of the motifs. All these results suggest that the defined scale of motifs with the finer scale should be carefully taken into consideration in the interpretation of turbulence coherent structures. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper we address a classical sequence mining problem, namely, that of finding the Closest Pair of Subsequences. Given a sequence A of length n, the problem is to identify two non-overlapping subsequences of length l each in A, such that their distance is minimum from among all such pairs. This is a fundamental problem that has a wide range of applications such as time series data mining, sequence data pattern matching, data signature identification, biological motif mining, metagenomic clustering, etc. To solve this problem, the state-of-the-art algorithm takes advantage of the overlapping parts of consecutive subsequences. By exploiting these overlaps, researchers have developed an algorithm with a run time of O(n2), which is independent of the dimension l. In this paper, we propose a deterministic algorithm called JUMP, which further pushes the limit by skipping unnecessary comparisons and multiplication operations, and improves the running time by a large factor. We have performed extensive experiments using standard benchmark datasets, and found that JUMP outperforms existing O(n2) methods by a factor of up to 100. Our experiments cover different settings of n and l and provide the readers a comprehensive and unbiased comparison under different conditions. © 2018 by SIAM.},

The integrative analysis based on high-dimensional regularized regression yielded lipid–transcript associations indirectly validated by Gene Ontology and promoter motif enrichment analyses. The co-localization of lipid-transcript associations using the genetic mapping of lipid traits in leaves and seedlings of a B73 × By804 recombinant inbred line population uncovered 323 genes involved in the metabolism of phospholipids, galactolipids, sulfolipids and glycerolipids. The resulting association network further supported the involvement of 50 gene candidates in modulating levels of representatives from multiple acyl-lipid classes.

Unlike traditional TSC approaches that seek to find global similarities in time series databases (e.g., Nearest Neighbor with Dynamic Time Warping distance) or methods specializing in locating local patterns/subsequences (e.g., shapelets), we extract solely statistical features from graphs that are generated from time series. Specifically, we augment time series by means of their multiscale approximations, which are further transformed into a set of visibility graphs. After extracting probability distributions of small motifs, density, assortativity, etc., these features are used for building highly accurate classification models using generic classifiers (e.g., Support Vector Machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting). Thanks to the way how we transform time series into graphs and extract features from them, we are able to capture both global and local features from time series. Based on extensive experiments on a large number of open datasets and comparison with five state-of-the-art TSC algorithms, our approach is shown to be both accurate and efficient: it is more accurate than Learning Shapelets and at the same time faster than Fast Shapelets. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)},

	abstract = {BCA2/Rabring7 is a BST2 cofactor that promotes the lysosomal degradation of trapped HIV-1 virions but also functions as a BST2-independent anti-HIV factor by targeting Gag for lysosomal degradation. Since many antiviral factors regulate the NF-κB innate signaling pathway, we investigated whether BCA2 is also connected to this proinflammatory cascade. Here, we show for the first time that BCA2 is induced by NF-κB-activating proinflammatory cytokines and that upregulation of BCA2 provides regulatory negative feedback on NF-κB. Specifically, BCA2 serves as an E3 SUMO ligase in the SUMOylation of IκBα, which in turn enhances the sequestration of NF-κB components in the cytoplasm. Since HIV-1 utilizes NF-κB to promote proviral transcription, the BCA2-mediated inhibition of NF-κB significantly decreases the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 (up to 4.4-fold in CD4+ T cells). Therefore, our findings indicate that BCA2 poses an additional barrier to HIV-1 infection: not only does BCA2 prevent assembly and release of nascent virions, it also significantly restricts HIV-1 transcription by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

A GUI, including an embedded molecular viewer, is provided for visualization of interaction energy time-series, distributions, an interaction energy matrix, interaction energy correlations and a residue correlation matrix. gRINN additionally offers construction and analysis of Protein Energy Networks, providing residue-based metrics such as degrees, betweenness-centralities, closeness centralities as well as shortest path analysis. gRINN is free and open to all users without login requirement at http://grinn.readthedocs.io. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {The problems of recurrent and anomalous pattern discovery in time series, e.g., motifs and discords, respectively, have received a lot of attention from researchers in the past decade. However, since the pattern search space is usually intractable, most existing detection algorithms require that the patterns have discriminative characteristics and have its length known in advance and provided as input, which is an unreasonable requirement for many real-world problems. In addition, patterns of similar structure, but of different lengths May co-exist in a time series. Addressing these issues, we have developed algorithms for variable-length time series pattern discovery that are based on symbolic discretization and grammar inference—two techniques whose combination enables the structured reduction of the search space and discovery of the candidate patterns in linear time. In this work, we present GrammarViz 3.0—a software package that provides implementations of proposed algorithms and graphical user interface for interactive variable-length time series pattern discovery. The current version of the software provides an alternative grammar inference algorithm that improves the time series motif discovery workflow, and introduces an experimental procedure for automated discretization parameter selection that builds upon the minimum cardinality maximum cover principle and aids the time series recurrent and anomalous pattern discovery. © 2018 ACM.},

In order to control the air pollution in urban cities, the government has deployed a lot of air pollutant monitoring equipment which produce massive multi-dimensional time series data. Through the motif discovery and analysis of these multi-dimensional time series, we can find the relationships and the rules between air pollutants to provide support and suggestions for controlling the air pollution. In this paper, a novel method on motif discovery and analysis for large-scale multi-dimensional time series data is proposed. The new method can effectively find multi-dimensional motifs and the correlation between them as much as possible, which reveals the underlying rule of different air pollutants. It is validated on practical historical data of air pollutants in Beijing. The experimental results show that the proposed method could obtain better performance than the related work. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Objectives:This study was designed to explore the molecular mechanisms of spinal cord injury (SCI) with time.Methods:The gene expression profile (GSE45006) including four non-injured spinal cord samples as sham-control group and 20 thoracic transected spinal cords samples as experimental group at different times was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The time-course changes of the SCI-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. In addition, time-series expression profile clusters of DEGs were obtained, followed by gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs. Moreover, the transcriptional regulatory network was constructed.Results:There were 1420, 492, 743, 568 and 533 DEGs respectively at d1, d3, w1, w2 and w8 compared with that of sham group. Importantly, 101 overlapped regulated DEGs were identified at five time points and 370 collaboratively regulated genes were identified in cluster 6. Significant functions of overlapped regulated DEGs were obtained including response to wounding and developmental process. In addition, the DEGs, such as CD14 molecule (CD14) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), were enriched mostly in the pathways related to tuberculosis, phagosome and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. From the transcriptional regulatory network, we identified some transription factors (TFs), including member of E26 transformation-specific (ETS) oncogene family (ELK1) and zinc finger and BTB domain containing 7A (Zbtb7a).Conclusion:The DEGs related to immune response during SCI may provide underlying targets for treatment of SCI. Moreover, the TFs ZBTB7A and ELK1 and their target gene (dual specificity phosphatase 18 (DUSP18)) might be therapeutic targets for the treatment of SCI. © 2016 International Spinal Cord Society.},

	abstract = {Research on forecasting has traditionally focused on building more accurate statistical models for a given time series. The models are mostly applied to limited data due to efficiency and scalability problems. However, many enterprise applications require scalable forecasting on large number of data series. For example, telecommunication companies need to forecast each of their customers’ traffic load to understand their usage behavior and to tailor targeted campaigns. Forecasting models are typically applied on aggregate data to estimate the total traffic volume for revenue estimation and resource planning. However, they cannot be easily applied to each user individually as building accurate models for large number of users would be time consuming. The problem is exacerbated when the forecasting process is continuous and the models need to be updated periodically. This paper addresses the problem of building and updating forecasting models continuously for multiple data series. We propose dynamic clustered modeling for forecasting by utilizing representative models as an analogy to cluster centers. We apply the models to each individual series through iterative nonlinear optimization. We develop two approaches: The Integrated Clustered Modeling integrates clustering and modeling simultaneously, and the Sequential Clustered Modeling applies them sequentially. Our findings indicate that modeling an individual’s behavior using its segment can be more scalable and accurate than the individual model itself. The grouped models avoid overfits and capture common motifs even on noisy data. Experimental results from a telco CRM application show the method is efficient and scalable, and also more accurate than having separate individual models. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {We present a novel method for the unsupervised discovery of behavioural motifs in larval Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. A motif is defined as a particular sequence of postures that recurs frequently. The animal's changing posture is represented by an eigenshape time series, and we look for motifs in this time series. To find motifs, the eigenshape time series is segmented, and the segments clustered using spline regression. Unlike previous approaches, our method can classify sequences of unequal duration as the same motif. The behavioural motifs are used as the basis of a probabilistic behavioural annotator, the eigenshape annotator (ESA). Probabilistic annotation avoids rigid threshold values and allows classification uncertainty to be quantified. We apply eigenshape annotation to both larval Drosophila and C. elegans and produce a good match to hand annotation of behavioural states. However, we find many behavioural events cannot be unambiguously classified. By comparing the results with ESA of an artificial agent's behaviour, we argue that the ambiguity is due to greater continuity between behavioural states than is generally assumed for these organisms. © 2015 The Authors.

A typical example of wearable cameras is Microsoft's SenseCam that can capture vast personal archives per day.

State-ofthe- Art techniques use supervised machine learning techniques to search and retrieve useful information, which requires prior knowledge about the data. We argue that these so-called rule-based and concept-based techniques may not offer the best solution for analysing large and unstructured collections of visual lifelogs. Treating lifelogs as time series data, we study in this paper how motifs techniques can be used to identify repeating events. We apply the Minimum Description Length (MDL) method to extract multi-dimensional motifs in time series data.

	abstract = {Background: The spatiotemporal patterns of correlated neural activity during the transition from wakefulness to general anesthesia have not been fully characterized. Correlation analysis of blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows segmentation of the brain into resting-state networks (RSNs), with functional connectivity referring to the covarying activity that suggests shared functional specialization. We quantified the persistence of these correlations following the induction of general anesthesia in healthy volunteers and assessed for a dynamic nature over time. Methods: We analyzed human fMRI data acquired at 0 and 1.2% vol sevoflurane. The covariance in the correlated activity among different brain regions was calculated over time using bounded Kalman filtering. These time series were then clustered into eight orthogonal motifs using a K-means algorithm, where the structure of correlated activity throughout the brain at any time is the weighted sum of all motifs. Results: Across time scales and under anesthesia, the reorganization of interactions between RSNs is related to the strength of dynamic connections between member pairs. The covariance of correlated activity between RSNs persists compared to that linking individual member pairs of different RSNs. Conclusions: Accounting for the spatiotemporal structure of correlated BOLD signals, anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness is mainly associated with the disruption of motifs with intermediate strength within and between members of different RSNs. In contrast, motifs with higher strength of connections, predominantly with regionspairs from within-RSN interactions, are conserved among states of wakefulness and sevoflurane general anesthesia. © 2016 Kafashan, Ching and Palanca.},

	abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) is a serious heart disease and a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Although some molecules (genes, miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs)) associated with MI have been studied in a specific pathological context, their dynamic characteristics in gene expressions, biological functions and regulatory interactions in MI progression have not been fully elucidated to date. In the current study, we analyzed time-series RNA expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We observed that significantly differentially expressed genes were sharply up- or down-regulated in the acute phase of MI, and then changed slowly until the chronic phase. Biological functions involved at each stage of MI were identified. Additionally, dynamic miRNA-TF co-regulatory networks were constructed based on the significantly differentially expressed genes and miRNA-TF co-regulatory motifs, and the dynamic interplay of miRNAs, TFs and target genes were investigated. Finally, a new panel of candidate diagnostic biomarkers (STAT3 and ICAM1) was identified to have discriminatory capability for patients with or without MI, especially the patients with or without recurrent events. The results of the present study not only shed new light on the understanding underlying regulatory mechanisms involved in MI progression, but also contribute to the discovery of true diagnostic biomarkers for MI. © 2016 Shi et al.

	abstract = {The ability to make predictions about future events is at the heart of much of science; so, it is not surprising that prediction has been a topic of great interest in the data mining community for the last decade. Most of the previous work has attempted to predict the future based on the current value of a stream. However, for many problems the actual values are irrelevant, whereas the shape of the current time series pattern may foretell the future. The handful of research efforts that consider this variant of the problem have met with limited success. In particular, it is now understood that most of these efforts allow the discovery of spurious rules. We believe the reason why rule discovery in real-valued time series has failed thus far is because most efforts have more or less indiscriminately applied the ideas of symbolic stream rule discovery to real-valued rule discovery. In this work, we show why these ideas are not directly suitable for rule discovery in time series. Beyond our novel definitions/representations, which allow for meaningful and extendable specifications of rules, we further show novel algorithms that allow us to quickly discover high quality rules in very large datasets that accurately predict the occurrence of future events. © 2015 ACM.},

	abstract = {Study hypothesis: Does primordial germ cell (PGC) activation start before mouse embryo implantation, and does the possible regulation of the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3-like (Dnmt3l) by transcription factor AP-2, gamma (TCFAP2C) have a role in this activation and in the primitive endoderm (PE)-epiblast (EPI) lineage specification? Study finding: A burst of expression of PGC markers, such as Dppa3/Stella, Ifitm2/Fragilis, Fkbp6 and Prdm4, is observed from embryonic day (E) 3.25, and some of them, together with the late germ cell markers Zp3, Mcf2 and Morc1,become restricted to the EPI subpopulation at E4.5, while the dynamics analysis of the PE-EPI transitions in the single-cell data suggests that TCFAP2C transitorily represses Dnmt3l in EPI cells at E3.5 and such repression is withdrawn with reactivation of Dnmt3l expression in PE and EPI cells at E4.5. What is known already: In the mouse preimplantation embryo, cells with the same phenotype take different fates based on the orchestration between topological clues (cell polarity, positional history and division orientation) and gene regulatory rules (at transcriptomics and epigenomics level), prompting the proposal of positional, stochastic and combined models explaining the specification mechanism. PGC specification starts at E6.0-6.5 post-implantation. In view of the important role of DNA methylation in developmental events, the cross-talk between some transcription factors and DNA methyltransferases is of particular relevance. TCFAP2C has a CpG DNA methylation motif that is not methylated in pluripotent cells and that could potentially bind on DNMT3L, the stimulatory DNA methyltransferase co-factor that assists in the process of de novo DNA methylation. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis has demonstrated that Dnmt3l is indeed a target of TCFAP2C. Study design, samples/materials, methods: We aimed to assess the timing of early preimplantation events and to understand better the segregation of the inner cell mass (ICM) into PE and EPI. We designed a single-cell transcriptomics dynamics computational study to identify markers of the PE-EPI bifurcation in ICM cells through searching for statistically significant (using the Student's t-test method) differently expressed genes (DEGs) between PE and EPI cells from E3.5 to E4.5. The DEGs common for E3.5 and E4.5 were used as the markers defining the steady states. We collected microarray and next-generation sequencing transcriptomics data from public databases from bulk populations and single cells from mice at E3.25, E3.5 and E4.5. The results are based on three independent single-cell transcriptomics data sets, with a fold change of 3 and P-value <0.01 for the DEG selection. Main results and the role of chance: The dynamics analysis revealed new transitory E3.5 and steady PE and EPI markers. Among the transitory E3.5 PE markers (Dnmt3l, Dusp4, Cpne8, Akap13, Dcaf12l1, Aaed1, B4galt6, BC100530, Rnpc3, Tfpi, Lgalsl, Ckap4 and Fbxl20), several (Dusp4, Akap13, Cpn8, Dcaf12l1 and Tfpi) are related to the extracellular regulated kinase pathway. We also identified new transitory E3.5 EPI markers (Sgk1, Mal, Ubxn2a, Atg16l2, Gm13102, Tcfap2c, Hexb, Slc1a1, Svip, Liph and Mier3), six new stable PE markers (Sdc4, Cpn1, Dkk1, Havcr1, F2r/Par1 and Slc7a6os) as well as three new stable EPI markers (Zp3, Mcf2 and Hexb), which are known to be late stage germ cell markers. We found that mouse PGC marker activation starts at least at E3.25 preimplantation. The transcriptomics dynamics analyses support the regulation of Dnmt3l expression by TCFAP2C. Limitations, reasons for caution: Since the regulation of Dnmt3l by TCFAP2C is based on computational prediction of DNA methylation motifs, Chip-Seq and transcriptomics data, functional studies are required to validate this result. Wider implications of thefindings: We identified a collection of previously undescribed E3.5-specific PE and EPI markers, and new steady PE and EPI markers. Identification of these genes, many of which encode cell membrane proteins, will facilitate the isolation and characterization of early PE and EPI populations. Since it is so well established in the literature that mouse PGC specification is a post-implantation event, it was surprising for us to see activation of PGC markers as early as E3.25 preimplantation, and identify the newly found steady EPI markers as late germ cell markers. The discovery of such early activation of PGC markers has important implications in the derivation of germ cells from pluripotent cells (embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells), since the initial stages of such derivation resemble early development. The early activation of PGC markers points out the difficulty of separating PGC cells from pluripotent populations. Collectively, our results suggest that the combining of the precision of single-cell omics data with dynamic analysis of time-series data can establish the timing of some developmental stages as earlier than previously thought.

With the fast growth of data volume, significant challenges in pattern recognition has emerged in diverse time series analysis systems. Since existing methods are inefficient and not applicable to large-scale and especially incremental time series, this paper proposes a novel and efficient pattern recognition method named MDLits for large-scale and incremental time series. It eliminates most redundant computation in the related works, and re-uses existing information by exploiting the correlation between existing data and newly-arrived ones. A Hadoop platform is implemented for clinical electrocardiography classification.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose deep transfer learning for classification of Gaussian networks with time-delayed regulations. To ensure robust signaling, most real world problems from related domains have inherent alternate pathways that can be learned incrementally from a stable form of the baseline. In this paper, we leverage on this characteristic to address the challenges of complexity and scalability. The key idea is to learn high dimensional network motifs from low dimensional forms through a process of transfer learning. In contrast to previous work, we facilitate positive transfer by introducing a triangular inequality constraint, which provides a measure for the feasibility of mapping between different motif manifolds. Network motifs from different classes of Gaussian networks are used collectively to pre-train a deep neural network governed by a Lyapunov stability condition. The proposed framework is validated on time series data sampled from synthetic Gaussian networks and applied to a real world dataset for the classification of basketball games based on skill level. We observe an improvement in the range of [15-25]% in accuracy and a saving in the range of [25-600]% in computational cost on synthetic as well as realistic networks with time-delays when compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, new insights into meaningful offensive formations in the Basketball games can be derived from the deep network. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The mass action model is a classical model which is often used to describe the kinetics of biochemical processes, so it is fit for GRN modeling. The ability to incorporate time-delayed parameters in this model enables different time delays of interaction between genes. Moreover, an efficient learning method which employs population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm and trigonometric differential evolution (TDE) algorithm TDE is proposed to automatically evolve the structure of the network and infer the optimal parameters from observed time-series gene expression data. Experiments on three well-known motifs of GRN and a real budding yeast cell cycle network show that the proposal can not only successfully infer the network structure and parameters but also has a strong anti-noise ability. Compared with other works, this method also has a great improvement in performances. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.},

Several notions of patterns exist, and many share the common idea of strictly specifying some parts of the pattern and to don't care about the remaining parts. Since the number of patterns can be exponential in the length of the sequences, pattern extraction focuses on statistically relevant patterns, where any attempt to further refine or extend them causes a loss of significant information (where the number of occurrences changes). Output-sensitive algorithms have been proposed to enumerate and list these patterns, taking polynomial time O(nc) per pattern for constant c > 1, which is impractical for massive sequences of very large length n. We address the problem of extracting maximal patterns with at most k don't care symbols and at least q occurrences. Our contribution is to give the first algorithm that attains a stronger notion of output-sensitivity, borrowed from the analysis of data structures: the cost is proportional to the actual number of occurrences of each pattern, which is at most n and practically much smaller than n in real applications, thus avoiding the aforementioned cost of O(nc) per pattern.},

And it is significant to quantify the correlation relationship between financial sequences since the financial market is a complex evolved dynamic system. Recently, we developed a new permutation-based entropy, called cross-permutation entropy (CPE), to detect the coupling structures between two synchronous time series. In this paper, we extend the CPE method to weighted cross-permutation entropy (WCPE), to address some of CPE's limitations, mainly its inability to differentiate between distinct patterns of a certain motif and the sensitivity of patterns close to the noise floor. It shows more stable and reliable results than CPE does when applied it to spiky data and AR(1) processes. Besides, we adapt the CPE method to infer the complexity of short-length time series by freely changing the time delay, and test it with Gaussian random series and random walks. The modified method shows the advantages in reducing deviations of entropy estimation compared with the conventional one. Finally, the weighted cross-permutation entropy of eight important stock indices from the world financial markets is investigated, and some useful and interesting empirical results are obtained. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The discovery of motifs is crucial for practitioners in order to understand and interpret the phenomena occurring in sequential data. Currently, motifs are searched among series sub-sequences, aiming at selecting the most frequently occurring ones. Search-based methods, which try out series sub-sequence as motif candidates, are currently believed to be the best methods in finding the most frequent patterns. However, this paper proposes an entirely new perspective infinding motifs. We demonstrate that searching is non-optimal since the domain of motifs is restricted, and instead we propose a principled optimization approach able to find optimal motifs. We treat the occurrence frequency as a function and time-series motifs as its parameters, therefore we learn the optimal motifs that maximize the frequency function. In contrast to searching, our method is able to discover the most repetitive patterns (hence optimal), even in cases where they do not explicitly occur as sub-sequences. Experiments on several real-life time-series datasets show that the motifs found by our method are highly more frequent than the ones found through searching, for exactly the same distance threshold. © 2016 ACM.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The primary aim was to characterize the temporal dynamics of postoperative pain intensity using symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX). The secondary aim was to explore the effects of sociodemographic and clinical factors on the SAX representations of postoperative pain intensity. Materials and Methods: We applied SAX to a large-scale time series database of 226,808 acute postoperative pain intensity ratings. Pain scores were stratified by patient age, sex, type of surgery, home opioid use, and postoperative day (POD), and costratified by age and sex. Cosine similarity, a metric that measures distance using vector angle, was applied to these motif data to compare pain behavior similarities across strata. Results: Across age groups, SAX clusters revealed a shift from lowto-low pain score transitions in older patients to high-To-high pain score transitions in younger patients, whereas analyses stratified by sex showed that males had a greater focus of pain score transitions among lower-intensity pain scores compared with females. Surgical stratification, using cardiovascular surgery as a reference, demonstrated that pulmonary surgery had the highest cosine similarity at 0.855. With POD stratification, POD 7 carried the greatest cosine similarity to POD 0 (0.611) after POD 1 (0.765), with POD 3 (0.419) and POD 4 (0.441) carrying the lowest cosine similarities with POD 0. Discussion: SAX offers a feasible and effective framework for characterizing large-scale postoperative pain within the time domain. Stratification of SAX representations demonstrate unique temporal dynamic profiles on the basis of age group, sex, type of surgery, preoperative opioid use, and across PODs 1 to 7. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

	abstract = {Environmental gene regulatory influence networks (EGRINs) coordinate the timing and rate of gene expression in response to environmental signals. EGRINs encompass many layers of regulation, which culminate in changes in accumulated transcript levels. Here, we inferred EGRINs for the response of five tropical Asian rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars to high temperatures, water deficit, and agricultural field conditions by systematically integrating time-series transcriptome data, patterns of nucleosome-free chromatin, and the occurrence of known cis-regulatory elements. First, we identified 5447 putative target genes for 445 transcription factors (TFs) by connecting TFs with genes harboring known cis-regulatory motifs in nucleosome free regions proximal to their transcriptional start sites. We then used network component analysis to estimate the regulatory activity for each TF based on the expression of its putative target genes. Finally, we inferred an EGRIN using the estimated transcription factor activity (TFA) as the regulator. The EGRINs include regulatory interactions between 4052 target genes regulated by 113 TFs. We resolved distinct regulatory roles for members of the heat shock factor family, including a putative regulatory connection between abiotic stress and the circadian clock. TFA estimation using network component analysis is an effective way of incorporating multiple genome-scale measurements into network inference. © 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

	abstract = {Four different histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4; two subunits each) constitute a histone octamer, around which DNA wraps to form histone-DNA complexes called nucleosomes. Amino acid residues in each histone are occasionally modified, resulting in several biological effects, including differential regulation of transcription. Core promoters that encompass the transcription start site have well-conserved DNA motifs, including the initiator (Inr), TATA box, and DPE, which are collectively called the core promoter elements (CPEs). In this study, we systematically studied the associations between the CPEs and histone modifications by integrating the Drosophila Core Promoter Database and time-series ChIP-seq data for histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) during development in Drosophila melanogaster via the modENCODE project. We classified 96 core promoters into four groups based on the presence or absence of the TATA box or DPE, calculated the histone modification ratio at the core promoter region, and transcribed region for each core promoter. We found that the histone modifications in TATA-less groups were static during development and that the core promoters could be clearly divided into three types: I) core promoters with continuous active marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac), ii) core promoters with a continuous inactive mark (H3K27me3) and occasional active marks, and iii) core promoters with occasional histone modifications. Linear regression analysis and non-linear regression by random forest showed that the TATA-containing groups included core promoters without histone modifications, for which the measured RNA expression values were not predictable accurately from the histone modification status. DPE-containing groups had a higher relative frequency of H3K27me3 in both the core promoter region and transcribed region. In summary, our analysis showed that there was a systematic link between the existence of the CPEs and the dynamics, frequency and influence on transcriptional activity of histone modifications. © 2016 Natsume-Kitatani, Mamitsuka.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

	abstract = {The all-pairs-similarity-search (or similarity join) problem has been extensively studied for text and a handful of other datatypes. However, surprisingly little progress has been made on similarity joins for time series subsequences. The lack of progress probably stems from the daunting nature of the problem. For even modest sized datasets the obvious nested-loop algorithm can take months, and the typical speed-up techniques in this domain (i.e., indexing, lower-bounding, triangular-inequality pruning and early abandoning) at best produce one or two orders of magnitude speedup. In this work we introduce a novel scalable algorithm for time series subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search. For exceptionally large datasets, the algorithm can be trivially cast as an anytime algorithm and produce high-quality approximate solutions in reasonable time. The exact similarity join algorithm computes the answer to the time series motif and time series discord problem as a side-effect, and our algorithm incidentally provides the fastest known algorithm for both these extensively-studied problems. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas for two time series data mining problems, including motif discovery and novelty discovery. © 2016 IEEE.},

Certain bases of orthogonal functions allow for a definition of fast update algorithms for approximations of time series in sliding or growing time windows. In fields such as technical data analytics, temporal data mining, or pattern recognition in time series, appropriate time series representations are needed to measure the similarity of time series or to segment them. This article bridges the gap between mathematical basic research and applications by making fast update techniques for standard polynomials and trigonometric polynomials accessible for time series classification or regression (e.g., forecasting), anomaly or motif detection in time series, etc. This is of utmost importance for online or big data applications. Time series or segments of time series will be represented by features derived from the orthogonal expansion coefficients of the approximating polynomials which capture the essential behavior in the time or spectral domain, i.e. trends and periodic behavior, using standard or trigonometric polynomials. Our experiments show that a reliable computation is possible at a very low runtime compared to a conventional least-squares approach.

Sensor data generated during personalized exercises or tasks may be too specific or inadequate to be evaluated using supervised methods such as classification. We propose multidimensional motif (MDM) discovery as a means for patient activity monitoring, since such motifs can capture repeating patterns across multiple dimensions of the data, and can serve as conformance indicators. Previous studies pertaining to mining MDMs have proposed approaches that lack the capability of concurrently processing multiple dimensions, thus limiting their utility in online scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient real-time approach to MDM discovery in body sensor generated time series data for monitoring performance of patients during therapy. We present two alternative models for MDMs based on motif co-occurrences and temporal ordering among motifs across multiple dimensions, with detailed formulation of the concepts proposed. The proposed method uses an efficient hashing based record to enable speedy update and retrieval of motif sets, and identification of MDMs. Performance evaluation using synthetic and real body sensor data in unsupervised motif discovery tasks shows that the approach is effective for 1) concurrent processing of multidimensional time series information suitable for real-time applications, 2) finding unknown naturally occurring patterns with minimal delay, and 3) tracking similarities among repetitions, possibly during therapy sessions. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) anomaly detection is an important technique for detecting dissimilar heartbeats which helps identify abnormal ECGs before the diagnosis process. Currently available ECG anomaly detection methods, ranging from academic research to commercial ECG machines, still suffer from a high false alarm rate because these methods are not able to differentiate ECG artifacts from real ECG signal, especially, in ECG artifacts that are similar to ECG signals in terms of shape and/or frequency. The problem leads to high vigilance for physicians and misinterpretation risk for nonspecialists. Therefore, this work proposes a novel anomaly detection technique that is highly robust and accurate in the presence of ECG artifacts which can effectively reduce the false alarm rate. Expert knowledge from cardiologists and motif discovery technique is utilized in our design. In addition, every step of the algorithm conforms to the interpretation of cardiologists. Our method can be utilized to both single-lead ECGs and multilead ECGs. Our experiment results on real ECG datasets are interpreted and evaluated by cardiologists. Our proposed algorithm can mostly achieve 100% of accuracy on detection (AoD), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value with 0% false alarm rate. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is highly accurate and robust to artifacts, compared with competitive anomaly detection methods. © 2015 Haemwaan Sivaraks and Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana.},

To investigate the mechanism underlying this dual regulation, we performed joint RAR/RXR ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq time series during the first 48 h of the RA-induced Primitive Endoderm (PrE) differentiation process in F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. We show here that this dual regulation is associated with RAR/RXR genomic redistribution during the differentiation process. In-depth analysis of RAR/RXR binding sites occupancy dynamics and composition show that in undifferentiated cells, RAR/RXR interact with genomic regions characterized by binding of pluripotency-associated factors and high prevalence of the non-canonical DR0-containing RA response element. By contrast, in differentiated cells, RAR/RXR bound regions are enriched in functional Sox17 binding sites and are characterized with a higher frequency of the canonical DR5 motif. Our data offer an unprecedentedly detailed view on the action of RA in triggering pluripotent cell differentiation and demonstrate that RAR/RXR action is mediated via two different sets of regulatory regions tightly associated with cell differentiation status. © 2015 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Decision tree algorithms were not traditionally considered for sequential data classification, mostly because feature generation needs to be integrated with the modelling procedure in order to avoid a localisation problem. This paper presents an Event Group Based Classification (EGBC) framework that utilises an X-of-N (XoN) decision tree algorithm to avoid the feature generation issue during the classification on sequential data. In this method, features are generated independently based on the characteristics of the sequential data. Subsequently an XoN decision tree is utilised to select and aggregate useful features from various temporal and other dimensions (as event groups) for optimised classification. This leads the EGBC framework to be adaptive to sequential data of differing dimensions, robust to missing data and accommodating to either numeric or nominal data types. The comparatively improved outcomes from applying this method are demonstrated on two distinct areas - a text based language identification task, as well as a honeybee dance behaviour classification problem. A further motivating industrial problem - hot metal temperature prediction, is further considered with the EGBC framework in order to address significant real-world demands. © 2017 Sun & Stirling.},

The framework provides entropy-based measures of information storage (self entropy, SE) and information transfer (joint transfer entropy (TE) and partial TE), which are applied here to detect complex dynamics of individual EEG sensors and causal interactions between different sensors. The measures are implemented according to a model-free and fully multivariate formulation of the framework, allowing the detection of nonlinear dynamics and direct links. Moreover, to deal with the issue of volume conduction, a compensation for instantaneous effects is introduced in the computation of joint and partial TE. The framework is applied to resting state EEG measured from healthy subjects in the eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions, evidencing condition-dependent patterns indicative of how information is distributed in the EEG sensor space. The SE was uniformly low during EO and significantly higher in the posterior areas during EC. The joint and partial TE were saturated by instantaneous effects, documenting how volume conduction blurs the detection of information flow in the EEG. However, the use of compensated TE measures led us to evidence meaningful patterns like the presence of local sinks of information flow and propagation motifs, and the emergence of prevalent front-to-back EEG propagation during EC. These findings support the feasibility of our information-theoretic approach to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of the scalp EEG in different conditions. © 2016 IEEE.},

Time series motifs, which are similar subsequences or frequently occurring patterns, have significant meanings for researchers especially in medical domain. With the fast growth of time series data, traditional methods for motif discovery are inefficient and not applicable to large-scale data. This work proposes an efficient Motif Discovery method for Large-scale time series (MDLats). By computing standard motifs, MDLats eliminates a majority of redundant computation in the related arts and reuses existing information to the maximum. All the motif types and subsequences are generated for subsequent analysis and classification. Our system is implemented on a Hadoop platform and deployed in a hospital for clinical electrocardiography classification.

	abstract = {Time series motifs have been in the literature for about fifteen years, but have only recently begun to receive significant attention in the research community. This is perhaps due to the growing realization that they implicitly offer solutions to a host of time series problems, including rule discovery, anomaly detection, density estimation, semantic segmentation, etc. Recent work has improved the scalability to the point where exact motifs can be computed on datasets with up to a million data points in tenable time. However, in some domains, for example seismology, there is an insatiable need to address even larger datasets. In this work we show that a combination of a novel algorithm and a high-performance GPU allows us to significantly improve the scalability of motif discovery. We demonstrate the scalability of our ideas by finding the full set of exact motifs on a dataset with one hundred million subsequences, by far the largest dataset ever mined for time series motifs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm can produce actionable insights in seismology and other domains. © 2016 IEEE.},

However this algorithm still has some weaknesses. First, users of Random Projection are required to choose suitable values for the motif length, wordlength and/or alphabet-size, which are unknown. Second, Random Projection still suffers from high computation cost. In this paper, we propose some novel techniques to improve Random Projection algorithm. These techniques consist of (i) using some time series segmentation methods to estimate the two important parameters: motif length and word length and (ii) speeding up the motif discovery process by a new way of shifting the sliding window. Experiments on five datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach can not only facilitate users in setting the parameters, but also improve the motif discovery in computational efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.},

In particular, recent approaches for discovering similar motifs of different lengths have been proposed. In this work, we show that such variable-length similarity-based motifs cannot be directly compared, and hence ranked, by their normalized dissimilarities. Specifically, we find that length-normalized motif dissimilarities still have intrinsic dependencies on the motif length, and that lowest dissimilarities are particularly affected by this dependency. Moreover, we find that such dependencies are generally non-linear and change with the considered data set and dissimilarity measure. Based on these findings, we propose a solution to rank (previously obtained) motifs of different lengths and measure their significance. This solution relies on a compact but accurate model of the dissimilarity space, using a beta distribution with three parameters that depend on the motif length in a non-linear way. We believe the incomparability of variable-length dissimilarities could have an impact beyond the field of time series, and that similar modeling strategies as the one used here could be of help in a more broad context and in diverse application scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background and objective: Signal segmentation and spike detection are two important biomedical signal processing applications. Often, non-stationary signals must be segmented into piece-wise stationary epochs or spikes need to be found among a background of noise before being further analyzed. Permutation entropy (PE) has been proposed to evaluate the irregularity of a time series. PE is conceptually simple, structurally robust to artifacts, and computationally fast. It has been extensively used in many applications, but it has two key shortcomings. First, when a signal is symbolized using the Bandt-Pompe procedure, only the order of the amplitude values is considered and information regarding the amplitudes is discarded. Second, in the PE, the effect of equal amplitude values in each embedded vector is not addressed. To address these issues, we propose a new entropy measure based on PE: the amplitude-aware permutation entropy (AAPE). Methods: AAPE is sensitive to the changes in the amplitude, in addition to the frequency, of the signals thanks to it being more flexible than the classical PE in the quantification of the signal motifs. To demonstrate how the AAPE method can enhance the quality of the signal segmentation and spike detection, a set of synthetic and realistic synthetic neuronal signals, electroencephalograms and neuronal data are processed. We compare the performance of AAPE in these problems against state-of-the-art approaches and evaluate the significance of the differences with a repeated ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test. Results: In signal segmentation, the accuracy of AAPE-based method is higher than conventional segmentation methods. AAPE also leads to more robust results in the presence of noise. The spike detection results show that AAPE can detect spikes well, even when presented with single-sample spikes, unlike PE. For multi-sample spikes, the changes in AAPE are larger than in PE. Conclusion: We introduce a new entropy metric, AAPE, that enables us to consider amplitude information in the formulation of PE. The AAPE algorithm can be used in almost every irregularity-based application in various signal and image processing fields. We also made freely available the Matlab code of the AAPE. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

To overcome such limitations, various approaches have been developed to infer the functional interaction structure from expression profiles. However, most of them have not been so successful due to the experimental limitations and computational complexity. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop a simple but effective methodology that can systematically identify the functional interaction structure of a gene network from time-series expression profiles. In particular, we need to take into account the different time delay effects in gene regulation since they are ubiquitously present. We have considered a new experiment that measures the overall expression changes after a perturbation on a specific gene. Based on this experiment, we have proposed a new inference method that can take account of the time delay induced while the perturbation affects its primary target genes. Specifically, we have developed an algebraic equation from which we can identify the subnetwork structure around the perturbed gene. We have also analyzed the influence of time delay on the inferred network structure. The proposed method is particularly useful for identification of a gene network with small variations in the time delay of gene regulation. © 2015 IEEE.},

The main purpose of REFII model is to automate time series analysis through a unique transformation model of time series. The advantage of this approach to a time series analysis is the linkage of different methods for time series analysis linking traditional data mining tools in time series, and constructing new algorithms for analyzing time series. REFII model is not a closed system, which means that there is a finite set of methods. This is primarily a model used for transformation of values of time series, which prepares data used by different sets of methods based on the same model of transformation in the domain of problem space. REFII model gives a new approach in time series analysis based on a unique model of transformation, which is a base for all kind of time series analyses. In combination with elements of other methods, such as self-organizing maps or frequent-pattern trees, REFII models can make new hybrid methods for efficient time temporal data mining. Similar principle of hybridization could be used as a tool for time series temporal pattern recognition.

	abstract = {Discovering approximately recurrent motifs (ARMs) in timeseries is an active area of research in data mining. Exact motif discovery is defined as the problem of efficiently finding the most similar pairs of timeseries subsequences and can be used as a basis for discovering ARMs. The most efficient algorithm for solving this problem is the MK algorithm which was designed to find a single pair of timeseries subsequences with maximum similarity at a known length. This paper provides three extensions of the MK algorithm that allow it to find the top K similar subsequences at multiple lengths using both the Euclidean distance metric and scale invariant normalized version of it. The proposed algorithms are then applied to both synthetic data and real-world data with a focus on discovery of ARMs in human motion trajectories. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The analysis of temporal behavioral patterns of home network users can reveal important information to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and help them to optimize their networks and offer new services (e.g., remote software upgrades, troubleshooting, energy savings). This study uses time series analysis of continuous traffic data from wireless home networks, to extract traffic patterns recurring within, or across homes, and assess the impact of different device types (fixed or portable) on home traffic. Traditional techniques for time series analysis are not suited in this respect, due to the limited stationary and evolving distribution properties of wireless home traffic data. We propose a novel framework that relies on a correlation-based similarity measure of time series, as well as a notion of strong stationarity to define motifs and dominant devices. Using this framework, we analyze the wireless traffic collected from 196 home gateways over two months. The proposed approach goes beyond existing application-specific analysis techniques, such as analysis of wireless traffic, which mainly rely on data aggregated across hundreds, or thousands of users. Our framework, enables the extraction of recurring patterns (motifs) from traffic time series of individual homes, leading to a much more fine-grained analysis of the behavior patterns of the users. We also determine the best time aggregation policy w.r.t. to the number and statistical importance of the extracted motifs, as well as the device types dominating these motifs and the overall gateway traffic. Our results show that ISPs can exceed the simple observation of the aggregated gateway traffic and better understand their networks. © 2016, Copyright is with the authors. national Conference on Extending Databa.},

	abstract = {Understanding both structure and dynamics is crucial for producing tailor-made ionic liquids (ILs). We studied the vibrational and structural dynamics of medium versus weakly hydrogen-bonded C-H groups of the imidazolium ring in ILs of the type [1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium][bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] ([Cnmim][NTf2]), with n=1, 2, and 8, by time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and quantum-classical hybrid (QCH) simulations. From the time series of the CARS spectra, dephasing times were extracted by modeling the full nonlinear response. From the QCH calculations, pure dephasing times were obtained by analyzing the distribution of transition frequencies. Experiments and calculations reveal larger dephasing rates for the vibrational stretching modes of C(2)-H compared with the more weakly hydrogen-bonded C(4,5)-H. This finding can be understood in terms of different H-bonding motifs and the fast interconversion between them. Differences in population relaxation rates are attributed to Fermi resonance interactions. Fast CARS: Hydrogen Bonding governs the vibrational dephasing in imidazolium ionic liquids. Combined time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and theoretical studies show that this process takes place on the fs-to-ps timescale and that dephasing is faster for C-H bonds that are involved in H bonds. Surprisingly, the fast dephasing and lifetimes reflect the behavior of macroscopic properties, such as viscosities and NMR relaxation times. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

	abstract = {Background/Objectives A cascade of gene activations under the control of Notch signalling is required during T-cell specification, when T-cell precursors gradually lose the potential to undertake other fates and become fully committed to the T-cell lineage.We elucidate how the gene/protein dynamics for a core transcriptional module governs this important process by computational means. Methods We first assembled existing knowledge about transcription factors known to be important for T-cell specification to form a minimal core module consisting of TCF-1, GATA-3, BCL11B, and PU.1 aiming at dynamical modeling. Model architecture was based on published experimental measurements of the effects on each factor when each of the others is perturbed. While several studies provided gene expression measurements at different stages of T-cell development, pure time series are not available, thus precluding a straightforward study of the dynamical interactions among these genes.We therefore translate stage dependent data into time series. A feed-forward motif with multiple positive feedbacks can account for the observed delay between BCL11B versus TCF-1 and GATA-3 activation by Notch signalling. With a novel computational approach, all 32 possible interactions among Notch signalling, TCF-1, and GATA-3 are explored by translating combinatorial logic expressions into differential equations for BCL11B production rate. Results Our analysis reveals that only 3 of 32 possible configurations, where GATA-3 works as a dimer, are able to explain not only the time delay, but very importantly, also give rise to irreversibility. The winning models explain the data within the 95% confidence region and are consistent with regard to decay rates. Conclusions This first generation model for early T-cell specification has relatively few players. Yet it explains the gradual transition into a committed state with no return. Encoding logics in a rate equation setting allows determination of binding properties beyond what is possible in a Boolean network. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Because of this, countless solutions have been devised but, to date, none of them seems to be fully satisfactory and flexible. In this article, we propose an innovative standpoint and present a solution coming from it: an anytime multimodal optimization algorithm for time series motif discovery based on particle swarms. By considering data from a variety of domains, we show that this solution is extremely competitive when compared to the state-of-the-art, obtaining comparable motifs in considerably less time using minimal memory. In addition, we show that it is robust to different implementation choices and see that it offers an unprecedented degree of flexibility with regard to the task. All these qualities make the presented solution stand out as one of the most prominent candidates for motif discovery in long time series streams. Besides, we believe the proposed standpoint can be exploited in further time series analysis and mining tasks, widening the scope of research and potentially yielding novel effective solutions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose a new efficient clustering-based method for discovering motif and detecting anomaly at the same time in large time series data. Our method first extracts motif/anomaly candidates from a time series by using significant extreme points and then clusters the candidates by using BIRCH algorithm. The proposed method computes anomaly scores for all sub-clusters and discovers the top motif based on the sub-cluster with the smallest anomaly score and detects the top anomaly based on the sub-cluster with the largest anomaly score. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can discover precise motif and anomaly with high time efficiency on large time series data.

	abstract = {Identification of potential cis-regulatory motifs controlling the development of C4 photosynthesis is a major focus of current research. In this study, we used time-series RNA-seq data collected from etiolated maize and rice leaf tissues sampled during a de-etiolation process to systematically characterize the expression patterns of C4-related genes and to further identify potential cis elements in five different genomic regions (i.e. promoter, 5'UTR, 3'UTR, intron, and coding sequence) of C4 orthologous genes. The results demonstrate that although most of the C4 genes show similar expression patterns, a number of them, including chloroplast dicarboxylate transporter 1, aspartate aminotransferase, and triose phosphate transporter, show shifted expression patterns compared with their C3 counterparts. A number of conserved short DNA motifs between maize C4 genes and their rice orthologous genes were identified not only in the promoter, 5'UTR, 3'UTR, and coding sequences, but also in the introns of core C4 genes. We also identified cis-regulatory motifs that exist in maize C4 genes and also in genes showing similar expression patterns as maize C4 genes but that do not exist in rice C3 orthologs, suggesting a possible recruitment of pre-existing cis-elements from genes unrelated to C4 photosynthesis into C4 photosynthesis genes during C4 evolution. © 2016 The Author 2016.

	abstract = {The extended motif discovery (EMD) algorithm, developed by Tanaka et al. (2005), is a well-known time series motif discovery algorithm which is based on minimum description length principle. One unique feature of the EMD algorithm is that it can determine the suitable length of the motif and hence does not require the length of the motif as a parameter supplied by user. Another interesting feature of the EMD is the lengths of each instances of a motif can be a bit different from each other and hence Tanaka et al. suggested that dynamic time warping (DTW) distance should be used to calculate the distances between the motif instances in this case. Due to the second feature, the EMD algorithm leads to a high computational complexity and is not easy to implement in practice. In this paper, we present an efficient implementation of the EMD algorithm in which we apply homothetic transformation to convert all pattern instances of different lengths into the same length so that we can easily calculate Euclidean distances between them. This modification accelerates the execution of the EMD remarkably and makes it easier to implement. Experimental results on seven real world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our EMD implementation method in time series motif discovery.

Many recently emerging applications running on high performance computing systems rely on motif discovery for various purposes, including efficient task scheduling, energy saving, etc.. In this paper, we propose an efficient motif discovery framework for CPU host load. The framework is elaborately designed to take into account the important properties in host load data. The framework benefits from its ability of on-line discovery and the adaptivity to work with massive data.

We first systematically carry out experiments and record different groups of time series signals from the wind field and the gas concentration field simultaneously. Then, we employ the visibility graph method for mapping the experimental measurements into complex networks and calculate network motif frequency. Next, subgraph ratio profiles (SRPs) for different flow fields are exploited based on the motif analysis. Finally, the hierarchical cluster method is adopted to identify a more accurate number of clusters in the SRPs, and then assign each network to one superfamily. The results suggest that the time series of gas concentration, wind speed and wind direction belong to different superfamilies. Moreover, we find that compared with wind direction signals, the correlations between gas concentration signals and wind speed records are stronger. These interesting and significant findings suggest that the motif of a complex network can be a useful tool for revealing the correlations of different flow fields. © 2016 IEEE.},

The handful of research efforts that consider those truths have met with limited success. This paper proposes an algorithm based on Multi-task Gaussian Process model to predict cash flows in funds. Purchase refers to cash inflow, while redemption refers to cash outflow. MTGP can learn the correlation within multiple time series and make regression on each time series simultaneously.

	abstract = {The ubiquitin-proteasome system represents the major pathway of selective intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotes. Misfolded proteins represent an important class of substrates for this pathway, and the failure to destroy misfolded proteins is associated with a number of human diseases. The transcription factor Rpn4 mediates a key proteotoxic stress response whose best known function is to control proteasome abundance by a homeostatic feedback mechanism. Here we identify the uncharacterized zinc finger protein Tmc1 as a dynamically regulated stress-responsive protein. Rpn4 induces TMC1 transcription in response to misfolded proteins. However, this response is counteracted by rapid proteasome-dependent degradation of Tmc1, which serves to normalize Tmc1 protein levels after induction. Precise control of Tmc1 levels is needed in vivo to survive multiple stressors related to proteostasis. Thus, Tmc1 represents a novel effector and substrate of the Rpn4 proteotoxic stress response. © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

	abstract = {Critical ICU events like acute hypotension and septic shock are dangerous complications, leading to multiple organ failures and eventual death. Previously, pattern mining algorithms have been employed for extracting interesting rules in various clinical domains. However, the extracted rules are directly investigated by clinicians for diagnosing a disease. Towards this purpose, there is a need to develop advanced prediction models which integrate dynamic patterns to learn a patient's physiological condition. In this study, a sequential contrast patterns-based classification framework is presented for detecting critical patient events, like hypotension and septic shock. Initially, a set of sequential patterns are obtained by using a contrast mining algorithm. Later, these patterns undergo post-processing, for conversion to two novel representations-(1) frequency-based feature space and (2) ordered sequences of patterns, which conserve positional information of a pattern in a time series sequence. Each of these representations are automatically used for developing classification models using SVM and HMM methods. Our results on hypotension and septic shock datasets from a large scale ICU database demonstrate better predictive capabilities, when sequential patterns are used as features. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Time series motifs are repeated patterns in long and noisy time series. Motifs are typically used to understand the dynamics of the source because repeated patterns with high similarity evidentially rule out the presence of noise. Recently, time series motifs have also been used for clustering, summarization, rule discovery and compression as features. For all such purposes, many high-quality motifs of various lengths are desirable and thus originate the problem of enumerating motifs for a wide range of lengths. Existing algorithms find motifs for a given length. A trivial way to enumerate motifs is to run one of the algorithms for the whole range of lengths. However, such parameter sweep is computationally infeasible for large real datasets. In this paper, we describe an exact algorithm, called (Formula presented.), to enumerate motifs. The algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than the naive algorithm. The algorithm frees us from re-discovering the same motif at different lengths and tuning multiple data-dependent parameters. The speedup comes from using a novel bound on the similarity function across lengths and the algorithm uses only linear space unlike other motif discovery algorithms. We also describe an approximate extension of MOEN algorithm that is faster and suitable for larger datasets. We describe five case studies in entomology, sensor fusion, power consumption monitoring and activity recognition where (Formula presented.) enumerates several high-quality motifs. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.},

Vehicle-tracking devices continuously transmit speed and location of corresponding vehicles by a certain time interval, 10 or 20 seconds for instance. The novelty of our approach is that we use dynamic time wraping technique (DTW) to measure the similarity between two time series of speeds from two vehicles on the same segment of road or highway. By using this technique, DTW distance gives more information about speed changing of vehicles than the other methods. We also conduct experiments to show relations between differentiation in averaged speed and the DTW distance from two vehicles running on the same highway. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Analyzing cardiovascular activity under abnormal heart beat is an intricate and vital job to the medical experts and complicated to novice persons. Electrocardiogram is a way to measure or diagnose abnormal heart rhythms to spot heart disease in human beings. These streaming medical signals can be well analyzed or diagnosed only with the prior knowledge. This paper deals with ECG signal analysis based on Time Series Motif as feature using Genetic Algorithm with double constraints. Genetic Algorithm has been employed to extract the features of various lengths from ECG signals. The proposed technique classifies the ECG signals into two classes (normal and abnormal) the classifier performance is measured in terms of Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy. Experimental results on standard MIT-BIH arrhythmia database shows that the proposed approach achieves 97.78% of accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.},

Vibrations, temperatures, pressures, flow rates are just the tip of the iceberg representing the huge database composed of the recorded measurements. However, only storing the data is of no value to the informationcentric society and the real value lies in the ability to properly utilize the gathered data. In this paper, we propose a knowledge discovery process designed to identify non-typical or anomalous patterns in time series data. The foundations of all the data mining tasks employed in this discovery process are based on the construction of a proper definition of non-typical pattern. Building on this definition, the proposed approach develops and implements techniques for identifying, labelling and comparing the sub-sections of the time series data that are of interest for the study. Extensive evaluations on artificial data show the effectiveness and intuitiveness of the proposed knowledge discovery process.},

In this paper, we propose an approach to detect anomalies and attacks on ATMs via motif discovery. Motifs are frequently unknown occurring sequences or events in a time series signal. State of the ATM is captured by innovative piezoelectric sensor networks to analyse the occurring vibrations. The captured signals are inspected by the Complex Quad-Tree Wavelet Packet transform which provides broad frequency analysis of a signal in various scales. Next, features are extracted from the selected scale based on the information content, to detect motifs.

	abstract = {Modern applications, including bioinformatics, time series, and web log analysis, require the extraction of frequent patterns, called motifs, from one very long (i.e., several gigabytes) sequence. Existing approaches are either heuristics that are error-prone, or exact (also called combinatorial) methods that are extremely slow, therefore, applicable only to very small sequences (i.e., in the order of megabytes). This paper presents ACME, a combinatorial approach that scales to gigabyte-long sequences and is the first to support supermaximal motifs. ACME is a versatile parallel system that can be deployed on desktop multi-core systems, or on thousands of CPUs in the cloud. However, merely using more compute nodes does not guarantee efficiency, because of the related overheads. To this end, ACME introduces an automatic tuning mechanism that suggests the appropriate number of CPUs to utilize, in order to meet the user constraints in terms of run time, while minimizing the financial cost of cloud resources. Our experiments show that, compared to the state of the art, ACME supports three orders of magnitude longer sequences (e.g., DNA for the entire human genome); handles large alphabets (e.g., English alphabet for Wikipedia); scales out to 16,384 CPUs on a supercomputer; and supports elastic deployment in the cloud. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Due to water quality and climate change issues, the catchment was heavily monitored as early as 2000. The data-driven analyses presented hereafter consider for the first time the whole 12-year long dataset. Such outstanding time-series enabled to address the following questions: which hydrological processes are controlling solutes exports in the catchment? How does the wetness state dynamic influences these dominant processes? Four original methods are used covering the range of temporal variability from flood event to seasonality and its inter-annual variations. A solute export conceptual model, composed of four hydrological compartments was proposed to explain the diversity of export dynamics for the catchment. Years presenting extrem hydro-meteorological conditions support this model, and emphasise on the importance of the change of catchment wetness state. Flood events also depend on that. Lastly, downslope advection and dispersion as well as riparian production, retention or mixing are also no negligible processes taking place in the catchment. Water quality signal is well structured in time and its structure is now further understood. The signal, strongly impacted by the agricultural use for given solutes, is dominated by seasonality but varies according to yearly hydrometeorological conditions. Comparing the solute export conceptual model built on Kervidy-Naizin to other catchments would be interesting to pinpoint driving factors. © Société Hydrotechnique de France, 2015.},

The discovery of waveform patterns, also known as time-series motifs, has been studied extensively; how- ever, available techniques for discovering frequently occur- ring time-series motifs were found lacking in either efficiency or quality: Standard subsequence clustering results in poor quality, to the extent that it has even been termed 'meaningless'. Variants of hierarchical clustering using techniques for efficient discovery of 'exact pair motifs' find high-quality frequent motifs, but at the cost of high computational complexity, making such techniques unusable for our voluminous vehicular sensor data. We show that good quality frequent motifs can be discovered using bounded spherical clustering of time-series subsequences, which we refer to as COIN clustering, with near linear complexity in time-series size. COIN clustering addresses many of the challenges that previously led to subsequence clustering being viewed as meaningless. We demonstrate that our technique efficiently discovers frequent motifs in voluminous vehicular sensor data as well as in publicly available data sets. Copyright 2015 ACM.},

Time series motif discovery is an essential and important task in time series mining. Discovering motifs in time series has attracted the researcher's attention for efficient time series classification problems and several algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem. However, these algorithms depend on predefined parameters like support, confidence, and length of the motif and they are sensitive to the parameters. To overcome the challenge, this paper proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm to discover a good trade-off between representative and interesting motif. The discovered motifs are validated for their potential interest in time series classification using nearest neighbour classifier. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can efficiently discover motifs with different lengths and more accurate than state-of-the-art time series techniques.

The model proposed is based on a real case study of keratinocytes differentiation, in which gene time-series data was generated upon Calcium stimulation. To achieve this we rely on the Process Hitting (PH) formalism that was designed to consider large-scale system analysis. We first propose an automatic way of detecting and translating biological motifs from the Pathway Interaction Database to the PH formalism.

When the forecasts are inaccurate, control room operators use their expertise, as well as the actual generation from previous days, to estimate the amount of energy to schedule. However, this is a challenge, and it would be useful for the operators to have additional information they can exploit to make better informed decisions. In this paper, we use techniques from time series analysis to determine if there are motifs, or frequently occurring diurnal patterns in wind generation data. We compare two different representations of the data and four different ways of identifying the number of motifs. Using data from wind farms in Tehachapi Pass and mid-Columbia Basin, we describe our findings and discuss how these motifs can be used to guide scheduling decisions. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

However, there is inadequate knowledge of the dynamics of the controllers' activities, especially from a quantitative perspective. This paper presents a novel network approach to uncover hidden patterns of the controllers' behavior based on the voice communication data. We convert the time series of the controllers' communication activities, which contain flights' information, into a time-varying network and a static network, referred to as temporal network and time-aggregated network, respectively. These networks reflect the interaction between the controllers and the flights on a sector level, and allow us to leverage network techniques to yield new and insightful findings regarding regular patterns and unique characteristics of the controllers' communication activities. The proposed methodology is applied to three real-world datasets, and the resulting networks are closely examined and compared in terms of degree distribution, community structure, and motifs. This network approach introduces a "spatial" element to the conventional analysis of the controllers' communication events, by identifying connectivity and proximity among flights. It constitutes a major step towards the quantitative description of the controller-flight dynamics, which is not widely seen in the literature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the advances of information technologies, today's building automation systems (BASs) are capable of managing building operational performance in an efficient and convenient way. Meanwhile, the amount of real-time monitoring and control data in BASs grows continually in the building lifecycle, which stimulates an intense demand for powerful big data analysis tools in BASs. Existing big data analytics adopted in the building automation industry focus on mining cross-sectional relationships, whereas the temporal relationships, i.e., the relationships over time, are usually overlooked. However, building operations are typically dynamic and BAS data are essentially multivariate time series data. This paper presents a time series data mining methodology for temporal knowledge discovery in big BAS data. A number of time series data mining techniques are explored and carefully assembled, including the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif discovery, and temporal association rule mining. This study also develops two methods for the efficient post-processing of knowledge discovered. The methodology has been applied to analyze the BAS data retrieved from a real building. The temporal knowledge discovered is valuable to identify dynamics, patterns and anomalies in building operations, derive temporal association rules within and between subsystems, assess building system performance and spot opportunities in energy conservation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Human activities may compromise biodiversity if external stressors such as nutrient enrichment endanger overall network stability by inducing unstable dynamics. However, some ecosystems maintain relatively high diversity levels despite experiencing continuing disturbances. This indicates that some intrinsic properties prevent unstable dynamics and resulting extinctions. Identifying these 'ecosystem buffers' is crucial for our understanding of the stability of ecosystems and an important tool for environmental and conservation biologists. In this vein, weak interactions have been suggested as stabilizing elements of complex systems, but their relevance has rarely been tested experimentally. Here, using network and allometric theory, we present a novel concept for a priori identification of species that buffer against externally induced instability of increased population oscillations via weak interactions. We tested our model in a microcosm experiment using a soil food-web motif. Our results show that large-bodied species feeding at the food web's base, so called 'trophic whales', can buffer ecosystems against unstable dynamics induced by nutrient enrichment. Similar to the functionality of chemical or mechanical buffers, they serve as 'biotic buffers' that take up stressor effects and thus protect fragile systems from instability. We discuss trophic whales as common functional building blocks across ecosystems. Considering increasing stressor effects under anthropogenic global change, conservation of these network-intrinsic biotic buffers may help maintain the stability and diversity of natural ecosystems. © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Energy management in offices requires efficient methods (e.g. non-intrusive load monitoring techniques, NILM) to monitor the large number of workstations and office appliances. The key purpose of this study is to ascertain the applicability of using time series subsequence data mining to study and classify the transient operations of typical appliances in an office. The approach involves discovering hidden subsequences (i.e. feature extraction) that are characteristic of individual appliance transient states, using an extension of Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX). Such characteristic features are used to create a repository of rules to help supervised classification of aggregate time series measurements. It is one of the first studies to demonstrate the potential of classifying subsequence features into individual appliances and their states within large aggregate time series data using a "Bag of Rules" approach. The results indicate that distinct, characteristic patterns represent office appliances and their states, in the form of SAX grammar rules. These patterns can then be used for NILM with promising results. This ongoing study demonstrates SAX based time series subsequence mining as a proof-of-concept; not only to discover similarities presented by appliance events but also to demonstrate their applicability to disambiguate aggregate signatures in the context of office NILM. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (iSAX) is widely used in time series data mining. Its popularity arises from the fact that it largely reduces time series size, it is symbolic, allows lower bounding and is space efficient. However, it requires setting two parameters: the symbolic length and alphabet size, which limits the applicability of the technique. The optimal parameter values are highly application dependent. Typically, they are either set to a fixed value or experimentally probed for the best configuration. In this work we propose an approach to automatically estimate iSAX's parameters. The approach - AutoiSAX - not only discovers the best parameter setting for each time series in the database, but also finds the alphabet size for each iSAX symbol within the same word. It is based on simple and intuitive ideas from time series complexity and statistics. The technique can be smoothly embedded in existing data mining tasks as an efficient sub-routine. We analyze its impact in visualization interpretability, classification accuracy and motif mining. Our contribution aims to make iSAX a more general approach as it evolves towards a parameter-free method. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Previous studies on enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) have focused on reconstructing genomic blueprints for the model polyphosphate-accumulating organism Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis. Here, a time series metatranscriptome generated from enrichment cultures of Accumulibacter was used to gain insight into anerobic/aerobic metabolism and regulatory mechanisms within an EBPR cycle. Co-expressed gene clusters were identified displaying ecologically relevant trends consistent with batch cycle phases. Transcripts displaying increased abundance during anerobic acetate contact were functionally enriched in energy production and conversion, including upregulation of both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound hydrogenases demonstrating the importance of transcriptional regulation to manage energy and electron flux during anerobic acetate contact. We hypothesized and demonstrated hydrogen production after anerobic acetate contact, a previously unknown strategy for Accumulibacter to maintain redox balance. Genes involved in anerobic glycine utilization were identified and phosphorus release after anerobic glycine contact demonstrated, suggesting that Accumulibacter routes diverse carbon sources to acetyl-CoA formation via previously unrecognized pathways. A comparative genomics analysis of sequences upstream of co-expressed genes identified two statistically significant putative regulatory motifs. One palindromic motif was identified upstream of genes involved in PHA synthesis and acetate activation and is hypothesized to be a phaR binding site, hence representing a hypothetical PHA modulon. A second motif was identified ~35 base pairs (bp) upstream of a large and diverse array of genes and hence may represent a sigma factor binding site. This analysis provides a basis and framework for further investigations into Accumulibacter metabolism and the reconstruction of regulatory networks in uncultured organisms. © 2016 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Changes in voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv channels) associate to proliferation in many cell types, including transfected HEK293 cells. In this system Kv1.5 overexpression decreases proliferation, whereas Kv1.3 expression increases it independently of KK+ fluxes. To identify Kv1.3 domains involved in a proliferation-associated signaling mechanism(s), we constructed chimeric Kv1.3-Kv1.5 channels and point-mutant Kv1.3 channels, which were expressed as GFP- or cherry-fusion proteins. We studied their trafficking and functional expression, combining immunocytochemical and electrophysiological methods, and their impact on cell proliferation. We found that the C terminus is necessary for Kv1.3-induced proliferation.We distinguished two residues (Tyr-447 and Ser-459) whose mutation to alanine abolished proliferation. The insertion into Kv1.5 of a sequence comprising these two residues increased proliferation rate. Moreover, Kv1.3 voltage-dependent transitions from closed to open conformation induced MEK-ERK1/2-dependent Tyr-447 phosphorylation. We conclude that the mechanisms for Kv1.3-induced proliferation involve the accessibility of key docking sites at the C terminus. For one of these sites (Tyr-447) we demonstrated the contribution of MEK/ERK-dependent phosphorylation, which is regulated by voltage-induced conformational changes. © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

The main purpose of REFII model is to automate time series analysis through a unique transformation model of time series. The advantage of this approach to a time series analysis is the linkage of different methods for time series analysis linking traditional data mining tools in time series, and constructing new algorithms for analyzing time series. REFII model is not a closed system, which means that there is a finite set of methods. This is primarily a model used for transformation of values of time series, which prepares data used by different sets of methods based on the same model of transformation in the domain of problem space. REFII model gives a new approach in time series analysis based on a unique model of transformation, which is a base for all kind of time series analyses. In combination with elements of other methods, such as self-organizing maps or frequent-pattern trees, REFII models can make new hybrid methods for efficient time temporal data mining. Similar principle of hybridization could be used as a tool for time series temporal pattern recognition.

A motif is a pair of time series subsequences, or two subsequences whose shapes are very similar to each other. Typical motif discovery algorithm requires a predefined motif length as its parameter. Discovering motif with arbitrary lengths introduces another problem, where selecting a suitable length for the motif is non-trivial since domain knowledge is often required. Thus, this work proposes a parameter-free motif discovery algorithm called k-Best Motif Discovery (kBMD) which requires no parameter as input, and as a result returns a set of all "Best Motif" that are ranked by our proposed scoring function which is based on similarity of motif locations and similarity of motif shapes. © 2012 IEEE.},

Several approaches have been proposed to solve this problem with no a-priori knowledge of the timeseries or motif characteristics. MK algorithm is the de facto standard exact motif discovery algorithm but it can discover a single motif of a known length. In this paper, we argue that it is not trivial to extend this algorithm to handle multiple motifs of variable lengths when constraints of maximum overlap are to be satisfied which is the case in many real world applications. The paper proposes an extension of the MK algorithm called MK++ to handle these conditions. We compare this extensions with a recently proposed approximate solution and show that it is not only guaranteed to find the exact top pair-motifs but that it is also faster. The proposed algorithm is then applied to several real-world time series. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Cellular networks are highly dynamic in their function, yet evolutionarily conserved in their core network motifs or topologies. Understanding functional tunability and robustness of network motifs to small perturbations in function and structure is vital to our ability to synthesize controllable circuits. In establishing core sets of network motifs, we selected topologies that are overrepresented in mammalian networks, including the linear, feedback, feed-forward, and bifan circuits. Static and dynamic tunability of network motifs were defined as the motif ability to respectively attain steady-state or transient outputs in response to pre-defined input stimuli. Detailed computational analysis suggested that static tunability is insensitive to the circuit topology, since all of the motifs displayed similar ability to attain predefined steadystate outputs in response to constant inputs. Dynamic tunability, in contrast, was tightly dependent on circuit topology, with some motifs performing superiorly in achieving observed time-course outputs. Finally, we mapped dynamic tunability onto motif topologies to determine robustness of motif structures to changes in topology and identify design principles for the rational assembly of robust synthetic networks. © 2014 Iadevaia et al.},

The motifs, or key phrases, provide strong cues to the identity of the underlying raga in both Hindustani and Carnatic styles of Indian music. Thus the automatic detection of such recurring basic melodic shapes from audio is of relevance in music information retrieval. The extraction of melodic attributes from polyphonic audio and the variability inherent in the performance, which does not follow a predefined score, make the task particularly challenging. In this work, we consider the segmentation of selected melodic motifs from audio signals by computing similarity measures on time series of automatically detected pitch values.

Firstly, the directed interactions between fMRI time-series are analyzed based on Granger causality analysis (GCA), by which the complex network is built up to reveal the causal relationships among different brain regions. Then the effective connectivity in complex network is described with a variety of network motifs, and the statistical properties of fMRI data are characterized according to the network motifs topological parameters.

	abstract = {Time series visualization is one of the most fundamental tasks, which is often used to discover patterns by a user interface. Many increasing interests in time series visualization in the last decade have resulted in the development of various state-of-the-art visualization techniques. In most cases, time series visualization is based on one of the representation frameworks which not only reduce the dimensionality, but sufficiently reflect the shapes of the raw time series as well. In this paper, a new time series visualization based on shape features is proposed to discover surprising patterns and mine frequent trends (motifs discovery). Since the shape features validly summarize both the global and local structures of time series and often use the slopes (or the angles) of the changeable values over time to describe the trends of time series, part of the work is to extract the important shape features and transform them into symbol string. After dimensionality reduction and symbol representation, a circle plotted by the visualization technique is split into many small sectors which simultaneously represent substring patterns of unequal length by multi-resolution function. Since the overall shape features of time series are based on data point importance, the surprising patterns and frequent trends can be accurately discovered even under a high compress ratio. The refined results of patterns discovery and frequent trends mining on financial and other time series datasets indicate that the proposed approach is an effective visualization tool for time series mining. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm is one of the most widely used benchmark algorithms in classification, supported by its simplicity and intuitiveness in finding similar instances in multivariate and large-dimensional feature spaces of arbitrary attribute scales. In contrast, only few scientific studies of k-NN exist in forecasting time series data, which have mainly assessed various distance metrics to identify similar univariate time series motifs in past data. In electricity load forecasting, k-NN studies are limited to identifying past motifs of the same dependent variable to match future realisations, in a non-causal approach to forecasting. However, causal information in the form of deterministic calendar information is readily available on past and future time series motifs, allowing the distinction between load profiles of working days, weekends and bank-holidays to be encoded as binary dummy variables, and to be efficiently included in the search for similar neighbours. In this paper, we propose a multivariate k-NN regression method for forecasting the electricity demand in the UK market which utilises binary dummy variables as a second feature to categorise the day being forecasted as a working day or a non-working day. We assess the efficacy of this approach in a robust empirical evaluation using UK electricity load data. The approach shows improvements beyond conventional k-NN approaches and accuracy beyond that of simple statistical benchmark methods. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The discovery of repeated structure, i.e. motifs/near-duplicates, is often the first step in exploratory data mining. As such, the last decade has seen extensive research efforts in motif discovery algorithms for text, DNA, time series, protein sequences, graphs, images, and video. Surprisingly, there has been less attention devoted to finding repeated patterns in audio sequences, in spite of their ubiquity in science and entertainment. While there is significant work for the special case of motifs in music, virtually all this work makes many assumptions about data (often to the point of being genre specific) and thus these algorithms do not generalize to audio sequences containing animal vocalizations, industrial processes, or a host of other domains that we may wish to explore. In this work we introduce a novel technique for finding audio motifs. Our method does not require any domain-specific tuning and is essentially parameter-free. We demonstrate our algorithm on very diverse domains, finding audio motifs in laboratory mice vocalizations, wild animal sounds, music, and human speech. Our experiments demonstrate that our ideas are effective in discovering objectively correct or subjectively plausible motifs. Moreover, we show our novel probabilistic early abandoning approach is efficient, being two to three orders of magnitude faster than brute-force search, and thus faster than real-time for most problems. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the last years, there is a huge increase of interest in application of time series. Virtually all human endeavors create time-oriented data, and the Data Mining community has proposed a large number of approaches to analyze such data. One of the most common tasks in Data Mining is classification, in which each time series should be associated to a class. Empirical evidence has shown that the nearest neighbor rule is very effective to classify time series data. However, the nearest neighbor classifier is unable to provide any form of explanation. In this chapter we describe a novel method to induce classifiers from time series data. Our approach uses standard Machine Learning classifiers using motifs and characteristics as features. We show that our approach can be very effective for classification, providing higher accuracy for most of the data sets used in an empirical evaluation. In addition, when used with symbolic models, such as decision trees, our approach provides very compact decision rules, leveraging knowledge discovery from time series. We also show two case studies with real world medical data.© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

We experimented with 4 electrocardiogram data sets from a benchmark repository to investigate the effect of alphabet size on the quantity and the quality of motifs from the time series classification perspective.

	abstract = {A key challenge in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease is matching patients to treatments that are most appropriate for them. Different cardiac assessment tools have been developed to address this goal. Recent research has focused on heart rate motifs, i.e., short-term heart rate sequences that are over- or under-represented in long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients experiencing cardiovascular outcomes, which provide novel and valuable information for risk stratification. However, this approach can leverage only a small number of motifs for prediction and results in difficult to interpret models. We address these limitations by identifying latent structure in the large numbers of motifs found in long-term ECG recordings. In particular, we explore the application of topic models to heart rate time series to identify functional sets of heart rate sequences and to concisely describe patients using task-independent features for various cardiovascular outcomes. We evaluate the approach on a large collection of real-world ECG data, and investigate the performance of topic mixture features for the prediction of cardiovascular mortality. The topics provided an interpretable representation of the recordings and maintained valuable information for clinical assessment when compared with motif frequencies, even after accounting for commonly used clinical risk scores.

With its recurrent motif patterns, we determined three embedded regulatory modules from the ERα core transcriptional network. The GO analyses revealed the distinct biological function associated with each of three embedded modules. The survival analysis showed the genes in each module were able to render a significant survival correlation in breast cancer patient cohorts. In summary, our Bayesian statistical modeling and modularity analysis not only reveals the dynamic properties of the ERα-centered regulatory network and associated distinct biological functions, but also provides a reliable and effective genomic analytical approach for the analysis of dynamic regulatory network for any given TF. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The information in HRM complements a variety of other clinical metrics including electrocardiographic (ECG) measures. While the HRM approach has value, it suffers from a focus on identifying and using information related to only a small number of discriminative patterns in heart rate time series, which loses valuable information among the full set of patterns in the data. We present a method based on topic models, an approach traditionally used in text analysis, to learn structure in the full set of short heart rate patterns in long-term ECG recordings. This model provides an interpretable representation of long-term ECG recordings and finds relationships amongst all short heart rate patterns across the entire patient population. When evaluated on data from 4,557 patients admitted with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, we show that heart rate topic models significantly improve risk stratification. This improvement is consistent even when considering information already available through the TIMI risk score and left ventricular ejection fraction, as well as several heart rate variability metrics. © 2012 CCAL.},

We present a data-driven approach for the discovery of short-time melodic patterns in large collections of Indian art music. The approach first discovers melodic patterns within an audio recording and subsequently searches for their repetitions in the entire music collection. We compute similarity between melodic patterns using dynamic time warping (DTW). Furthermore, we investigate four different variants of the DTW cost function for rank refinement of the obtained results. The music collection used in this study comprises 1,764 audio recordings with a total duration of 365 hours. Over 13 trillion DTW distance computations are done for the entire dataset. Due to the computational complexity of the task, different lower bounding and early abandoning techniques are applied during DTW distance computation. An evaluation based on expert feedback on a subset of the dataset shows that the discovered melodic patterns are musically relevant. Several musically interesting relationships are discovered, yielding further scope for establishing novel similarity measures based on melodic patterns. The discovered melodic patterns can further be used in challenging computational tasks such as automatic raga recognition, composition identification and music recommendation. © 2014 IEEE.},

In this study, we collected ESP from six different periods (0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-36 h, and 36-48 h) from C. sinensis adults. Using a shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis, we found 187, 80, 103, 58, 248, and 383 proteins, respectively. Among these proteins, we selected methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MAP-2, presented in 24-36 h and 36-48 h ESP) and acid phosphatase (AP, presented in 3-6 h, 12-24 h, 24-36 h, and 36-48 h ESP) for further study. Bioinformatics analysis showed that CsMAP-2 has metallopeptidase family M24, unique lysine residue-rich and acidic residue-rich domain, SGTS motif, and auto-cleavage point; and that CsAP has possible signal sequence cleavage site, acid phosphate domain, and two histidine acid phosphatases active regions. CsMAP-2 and CsAP's cDNA have 1,425 bp and1,410 bp ORF, encoding 475 and 470 amino acid proteins and weighing 55.3840 kDa and 55.2875 kDa, respectively. MAP-2 and AP were identified as antigens present in the ESP and circulating antigens by immunoblot analysis, which were also found expressing in the eggs, metacercaria, and adult stages of C. sinensis. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that they were located in tegument and intestinal cecum of adult. MTT assay showed that they could inhibit hepatic stellate cell line (LX-2) proliferation. These findings presented the compositions of different period excretory secretary products from C. sinensis adults. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of ∼22nt non-coding RNAs that potentially regulate over 60% of human protein-coding genes. miRNA activity is highly specific, differing between cell types, developmental stages and environmental conditions, so the identification of active miRNAs in a given sample is of great interest. Here we present a novel computational approach for analyzing both mRNA sequence and gene expression data, called MixMir. Our method corrects for 3′UTR background sequence similarity between transcripts, which is known to correlate with mRNA transcript abundance. We demonstrate that after accounting for kmer sequence similarities in 3′UTRs, a statistical linear model based on motif presence/absence can effectively discover active miRNAs in a sample. MixMir utilizes fast software implementations for solving mixed linear models, which are widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Essentially we use 3′UTR sequence similarity in place of population cryptic relatedness in the GWAS problem. Compared to similar methods such as miReduce, Sylamer and cWords, we found that MixMir performed better at discovering true miRNA motifs in three mouse Dicer-knockout experiments from different tissues, two of which were collected by our group. We confirmed these results on protein and mRNA expression data obtained from miRNA transfection experiments in human cell lines. © The Author(s) 2014.},

This novel method is able to automatically find motifs in a multivariate time series and generate a model which is capable of segmenting the series in a real-time system.

The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problem such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. In addition to mining massive datasets, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible. © 2012 ACM.},

	abstract = {A streaming time series is a continuous and unbounded group of chronological observations that are found in many scientific and business applications. Motifs that are frequent subsequences are highly representative for the time series and play an important role in time series mining. Discovering motifs in time series has received much attention during recent years, and several algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem. However, these algorithms can only find motifs with a predefined length, which greatly affects their performance and practicality. Recent algorithms can discover motifs with different lengths, but require multiple scanning of the time series and are thus not applicable to streaming time series. In addition, it is difficult to determine the optimal length of interesting motifs; a suboptimal choice results in missing the key motifs or having too many redundant motifs. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the notion of a (Formula presented.) if there is no motif with a longer length having the same number of occurrences. We propose a novel algorithm (Formula presented.) to discover closed motifs in a single scan for streaming time series. We also use the nearest neighbor classifier with the most distinctive closed motifs to validate their potential in time series classification. Extensive experiments show that our approach can efficiently discover motifs with different lengths. In addition, our closed-motif-based classifier is shown to be more accurate than (Formula presented.), a state-of-the-art time series classifier. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of (Formula presented.) on several large datasets in diverse domains like video surveillance, sensor networks, and biometrics. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.},

We are thus interested in some patterns which have a high frequency in our database of time series and might help to generate candidates for various tasks in the area of time series mining. During the symbol-ization phase, we transform the numerical time series into a symbolic time series by i) splitting this latter into consecutive subsequences, ii) using a clustering algorithm to cluster these subsequences, each subsequence being then replaced by the name of its cluster to produce the symbolic time series. In the second phase, we use a sliding window to create a collection of transactions from the symbolic time series, then we use some algorithm for mining sequential pattern to find out some interesting motifs in the original time series.

	abstract = {A number of transcriptional control elements are activated when Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are submitted to various stress conditions, including high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). Exposure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to HHP results in global transcriptional reprogramming, similar to that observed under other industrial stresses, such as temperature, ethanol and oxidative stresses. Moreover, treatment with a mild hydrostatic pressure renders yeast cells multistress tolerant. In order to identify transcriptional factors involved in coordinating response to high hydrostatic pressure, we performed a time series microarray expression analysis on a wild S. cerevisiae strain exposed to 50 MPa for 30 min followed by recovery at atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) for 5, 10 and 15 min. We identified transcription factors and corresponding DNA and RNA motifs targeted in response to hydrostatic pressure. Moreover, we observed that different motif elements are present in the promoters of induced or repressed genes during HHP treatment. Overall, as we have already published, mild HHP treatment to wild yeast cells provides multiple protection mechanisms, and this study suggests that the TFs and motifs identified as responding to HHP may be informative for a wide range of other biotechnological and industrial applications, such as fermentation, that may utilize HHP treatment. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Time series motifs are repeated segments in a long time series that, if exist, carry precise information about the underlying source of the time series. Motif discovery in time series data has received significant attention in the data mining community since its inception, principally because, motif discovery is meaningful and more likely to succeed when the data is large. Algorithms for motif discovery generally deal with three aspects the definition of the motifs, domain based preprocessing, and finally, the algorithmic steps. Typical definitions of motifs signify the similarity or the support of the motifs. Domains impose preprocessing requirements to meaningful motif finding such as data alignment, interpolation, and transformation. Motif discovery algorithms vary based on exact or approximate evaluation of the definition. In addition, algorithms require different representations [Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), DFT etc.] and similarity measures [correlation, dynamic time warping (DTW) distance etc.] for time series segments. In this paper, we discuss these three facets in detail with examples taken from the literature. We briefly describe a set of applications of time series motif in various domains and elaborate on a certain application in entomology to analyze insect behavior.

	abstract = {Brain function requires the control of inter-circuit interactions on timescales faster than synaptic changes. In particular, strength and direction of causal influences between neural populations (described by the so-called directed functional connectivity)must be reconfigurable even when the underlying structural connectivity is fixed. Such influences can be quantified through causal analysis of time-series of neural activity with tools like Transfer Entropy. But how can manifold functional networks stem from fixed structures? Considering model systems at different scales, like neuronal cultures or cortical multi-areal motifs, we show that "function and information follow dynamics", rather than structure. Different dynamic states of a same structural network, characterized by different synchronization properties, are indeed associated to different directed functional networks, corresponding to alternative information flow patterns. Here we discuss how suitable generalizations of Transfer Entropy, taking into account switching between collective states of the analyzed circuits, can provide a picture of directed functional interactions in agreement with a "ground-truth" description at the dynamical systems level. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, large amounts of other types of biological data and knowledge are available, such as knockout experiments, annotations and so on, and it has been postulated that integration of these can improve model quality. However, integration has not been fully explored to date. Here, we present a novel integrative framework for different types of data that aims to enhance model inference. This is based on evolutionary computation and uses different types of knowledge to introduce a novel customised initialisation and mutation operator and complex evaluation criteria, used to distinguish between candidate models. Specifically, the algorithm uses information from (i) knockout experiments, (ii) annotations of transcription factors, (iii) binding site motifs (expressed as position weight matrices) and (iv) DNA sequence of gene promoters, to drive the algorithm towards more plausible network structures. Further, the evaluation basis is also extended to include structure information included in these additional data. This framework is applied to both synthetic and real gene expression data. Models obtained by data integration display both quantitative and qualitative improvement. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Understanding gene transcription regulatory networks is critical to deciphering the molecular mechanisms of different cellular states. Most studies focus on static transcriptional networks. In the current study, we used the gastrin-regulated system as a model to understand the dynamics of transcriptional networks composed of transcription factors (TFs) and target genes (TGs). The hormone gastrin activates and stimulates signaling pathways leading to various cellular states through transcriptional programs. Dysregulation of gastrin can result in cancerous tumors, for example. However, the regulatory networks involving gastrin are highly complex, and the roles of most of the components of these networks are unknown. We used time series microarray data of AR42J adenocarcinoma cells treated with gastrin combined with static TF-TG relationships integrated from different sources, and we reconstructed the dynamic activities of TFs using network component analysis (NCA). Based on the peak expression of TGs and activity of TFs, we created active sub-networks at four time ranges after gastrin treatment, namely immediate-early (IE), mid-early (ME), mid-late (ML) and very late (VL). Network analysis revealed that the active sub-networks were topologically different at the early and late time ranges. Gene ontology analysis unveiled that each active sub-network was highly enriched in a particular biological process. Interestingly, network motif patterns were also distinct between the sub-networks. This analysis can be applied to other time series microarray datasets, focusing on smaller sub-networks that are activated in a cascade, allowing better overview of the mechanisms involved at each time range. © 2014 Doni Jayavelu, Bar.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ubiquitously expressed small non-coding RNAs that, in most cases, negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. miRNAs are involved in fine-tuning fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, cell death and cell cycle control and are believed to confer robustness to biological responses. Here, we investigated simultaneously the transcriptional changes of miRNA and mRNA expression levels over time after activation of the Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway by interferon-c stimulation of melanoma cells. To examine global miRNA and mRNA expression patterns, time-series microarray data were analysed. We observed delayed responses of miRNAs (after 24-48 h) with respect to mRNAs (12-24 h) and identified biological functions involved at each step of the cellular response. Inference of the upstream regulators allowed for identification of transcriptional regulators involved in cellular reactions to interferon-c stimulation. Linking expression profiles of transcriptional regulators and miRNAs with their annotated functions, we demonstrate the dynamic interplay of miRNAs and upstream regulators with biological functions. Finally, our data revealed network motifs in the form of feed-forward loops involving transcriptional regulators, mRNAs and miRNAs. Additional information obtained from integrating time-series mRNA and miRNA data may represent an important step towards understanding the regulatory principles of gene expression. © The Author(s) 2013.},

	abstract = {Co-ordinating metabolism and growth is a key challenge for all organisms. Despite fluctuating environments, cells must produce the same metabolic outputs to thrive. The mechanisms underlying this 'growth homeostasis' are known in bacteria and eukaryotes, but remain unexplored in archaea. In the model archaeon Halobacterium salinarum, the transcription factor TrmB regulates enzyme-coding genes in diverse metabolic pathways in response to glucose. However, H. salinarum is thought not to catabolize glucose. To resolve this discrepancy, we demonstrate that TrmB regulates the gluconeogenic production of sugars incorporated into the cell surface S-layer glycoprotein. Additionally, we show that TrmB-DNA binding correlates with instantaneous growth rate, likely because S-layer glycosylation is proportional to growth. This suggests that TrmB transduces a growth rate signal to co-regulated metabolic pathways including amino acid, purine, and cobalamin biosynthesis. Remarkably, the topology and function of this growth homeostatic network appear conserved across domains despite extensive alterations in protein components. © 2014 The Authors.

The large quantities of time series data collected from these complex systems often exhibit two important characteristics: the data is a combination of various superimposed effects operating at different time scales, and each effect shows a fair degree of repetition. Each of these effects can be described by a small collection of motifs: recurring temporal patterns in the data. We propose a method to discover characteristic and potentially overlapping motifs at multiple time scales, taking into account systemic deformations and temporal warping. Our method is based on a combination of scale-space theory and the Minimum Description Length principle. We show its effectiveness on two time series datasets from real world applications.

Whole time series clustering considers how to cluster multiple time series, and the other one is Subsequence Time Series (STS) clustering, a clustering of subparts or subsequences within a single time series. Deplorably, STS clustering is not preferable even though it had widely been used as a subroutine in various mining tasks, e.g., rule discovery, anomaly detection, or classification, due to the recent finding a decade ago that STS clustering problem can produce meaningless results. There have been numerous attempts to resolve this problem but seemed to be unsuccessful. Until the two most recent attempts, they seem to accomplish in producing meaningful results; however, their approaches do need some predefined constraint values, such as the width of the subsequences that are in fact quite subjective and sensitive. Thus, we propose a novel parameter-free clustering technique to eliminate this problem by utilizing a motif discovery algorithm and some statistical principles to properly determine these parameters. Our experimental results from well-known datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in selecting the proper subsequence width, and in turn leading to meaningful and highly accurate results.  ©2013 IEEE.},

The model uses nonparametric Bayesian methods to describe both the motifs and their occurrences in documents. We derive an inference scheme to automatically and simultaneously recover the recurrent motifs (both their characteristics and number) and their occurrence instants in each document. The model is widely applicable and is illustrated on datasets coming from multiple modalities, mainly videos from static cameras and audio localization data. The rich semantic interpretation that the model offers can be leveraged in tasks such as event counting or for scene analysis. The approach is also used as a mean of doing soft camera calibration in a camera network. A thorough study of the model parameters is provided and a cross-platform implementation of the inference algorithm will be made publicly available. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that we can gain additional information on time series by investigating their accompanying complex networks. In this work, we investigate the fundamental topological and fractal properties of recurrence networks constructed from fractional Brownian motions (FBMs). First, our results indicate that the constructed recurrence networks have exponential degree distributions; the average degree exponent ©λ increases first and then decreases with the increase of Hurst index H of the associated FBMs; the relationship between H and ©λ can be represented by a cubic polynomial function. We next focus on the motif rank distribution of recurrence networks, so that we can better understand networks at the local structure level. We find the interesting superfamily phenomenon, i.e., the recurrence networks with the same motif rank pattern being grouped into two superfamilies. Last, we numerically analyze the fractal and multifractal properties of recurrence networks. We find that the average fractal dimension ©dB of recurrence networks decreases with the Hurst index H of the associated FBMs, and their dependence approximately satisfies the linear formula ©dB2-H, which means that the fractal dimension of the associated recurrence network is close to that of the graph of the FBM. Moreover, our numerical results of multifractal analysis show that the multifractality exists in these recurrence networks, and the multifractality of these networks becomes stronger at first and then weaker when the Hurst index of the associated time series becomes larger from 0.4 to 0.95. In particular, the recurrence network with the Hurst index H=0.5 possesses the strongest multifractality. In addition, the dependence relationships of the average information dimension ©D(1)and the average correlation dimension ©D(2) on the Hurst index H can also be fitted well with linear functions. Our results strongly suggest that the recurrence network inherits the basic characteristic and the fractal nature of the associated FBM series. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

It is assumed that a set of event sequences, where each event has an id and an occurrence time, is collected from an application. Our work is motivated by the observation that many associated events in multiple temporal sequences do not occur concurrently but sequentially. In an empirical study, we apply our method to two different application domains. Firstly, we use MAF to detect multivariate motifs from multiple time series data. Existing approaches all assume that the univariate elements of a multivariate motif occur synchronously. The experimental results on both synthetic and read data sets show that our method finds both synchronous and non-synchronous multivariate motifs. Secondly, we apply our method to mine frequent episodes from event streams. Current methods often ask users to provide possible lengths of frequent episodes. The results on neuronal spike simulation data show that MAF automatically detects episodes with variable time delays. © 2013 Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

	abstract = {Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine, and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms, including classification, clustering, motif discovery, anomaly detection, and so on. The difficulty of scaling a search to large datasets explains to a great extent why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following unintuitive fact: in large datasets we can exactly search under Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We explain how our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problems such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. Moreover, we show how our ideas allow us to efficiently support the uniform scaling distance measure, a measure whose utility seems to be underappreciated, but which we demonstrate here. In addition to mining massive datasets with up to one trillion data points, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible. © 2013 ACM.},

The quality of segmentation techniques is mostly measured indirectly using the least-squares error that an approximation algorithm makes when reconstructing the segments of a time series given by segmentation. In this article, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm, measuring the occurrence of segmentation points directly.

Data mining techniques can help find those hidden laws, such as flood frequency and abrupt change, which are useful for the decision port of hydrological prediction and flood control scheduling. Motif is a word from biology, which represents the repeated occurring patterns in time series. Hence, time series motif mining is to find repeated patterns in a time-series using the methodology of data mining. Aiming at the characteristics of hydrological time series and special needs of flood and drought knowledge discovery, a novel motif mining approach named GSB-VLMD (Grammars & Semantics Based-Variable Length Motifs Discovery) is proposed. It is based on wavelet transform, extreme points decomposition and symbolization. Wavelet transform is responsible for the reduction of noise and smoothing; extreme points decomposition is capable of extracting the semantic information about flood and drought, and symbolization will prepare the discrete input for the following the Sequitur algorithm, which performs the motif mining process. Experiments on the real water level time series of Taihu Lake as source data are carried out, which has proved the validity and the utility of the novel approach proposed in this paper.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe an approach to classifying heart sounds (classes Normal, Murmur and Extra-systole) that is based on the discretization of sound signals using the SAX (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation) representation. The ability of automatically classifying heart sounds or at least support human decision in this task is socially relevant to spread the reach of medical care using simple mobile devices or digital stethoscopes. In our approach, sounds are first pre-processed using signal processing techniques (decimate, low-pass filter, normalize, Shannon envelope). Then the pre-processed symbols are transformed into sequences of discrete SAX symbols. These sequences are subject to a process of motif discovery. Frequent sequences of symbols (motifs) are adopted as features. Each sound is then characterized by the frequent motifs that occur in it and their respective frequency. This is similar to the term frequency (TF) model used in text mining. In this paper we compare the TF model with the application of the TFIDF (Term frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) and the use of bi-grams (frequent size two sequences of motifs). Results show the ability of the motifs based TF approach to separate classes and the relative value of the TFIDF and the bi-grams variants. The separation of the Extra-systole class is overly difficult and much better results are obtained for separating the Murmur class. Empirical validation is conducted using real data collected in noisy environments. We have also assessed the cost-reduction potential of the proposed methods by considering a fixed cost model and using a cost sensitive meta algorithm. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

Motifs are typically used to understand the dynamics of the source because repeated patterns with high similarity evidentially rule out the presence of noise. Recently, time series motifs have also been used for clustering, summarization, rule discovery and compression as features. For all such purposes, many high quality motifs of various lengths are desirable and thus, originates the problem of enumerating motifs for a wide range of lengths. Existing algorithms find motifs for a given length. A trivial way to enumerate motifs is to run one of the algorithms for the whole range of lengths. However, such parameter sweep is computationally infeasible for large real datasets. In this paper, we describe an exact algorithm, called MOEN, to enumerate motifs. The algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than the naive algorithm. The algorithm frees us from re-discovering the same motif at different lengths and tuning multiple data-dependent parameters. The speedup comes from using a novel bound on the similarity function across lengths and the algorithm uses only linear space unlike other motif discovery algorithms. We describe three case studies in entomology and activity recognition where MOEN enumerates several high quality motifs. © 2013 IEEE.},

The method relies on the fact that patterns may be too disparate in amplitudes and variances and proceeds by assigning weights for each extracted vector when computing the relative frequencies associated with every motif. Simulations were conducted over synthetic and real data for a weighting scheme inspired by the variance of each pattern.

STS clustering’s main objective is to cluster similar underlying subsequences together. Other than the known problem of meaninglessness in the STS clustering results, another challenge is on clustering where the subsequence patterns have variable lengths. General approaches provide a solution only to the problems where the range of width variability is small and under some predefined parameters, which turns out to be impractical for real-world data. Thus, we propose a new algorithm that can handle much larger variability in the pattern widths, while providing the parameter-free characteristic, so that the users would no longer suffer from the difficult task of parameter selection. The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and motif discovery technique are adopted to be used in determining the proper widths of the subsequences.

	abstract = {Motifs are frequent patterns used to identify biological functionality in genomic sequences, periodicity in time series, or user trends in web logs. In contrast to a lot of existing work that focuses on collections of many short sequences, modern applications require mining of motifs in one very long sequence (i.e., in the order of several gigabytes). For this case, there exist statistical approaches that are fast but inaccurate; or combinatorial methods that are sound and complete. Unfortunately, existing combinatorial methods are serial and very slow. Consequently, they are limited to very short sequences (i.e., a few megabytes), small alphabets (typically 4 symbols for DNA sequences), and restricted types of motifs. This paper presents ACME, a combinatorial method for extracting motifs from a single very long sequence. ACME arranges the search space in contiguous blocks that take advantage of the cache hierarchy in modern architectures, and achieves almost an order of magnitude performance gain in serial execution. It also decomposes the search space in a smart way that allows scalability to thousands of processors with more than 90% speedup. ACME is the only method that: (i) scales to gigabyte-long sequences; (ii) handles large alphabets; (iii) supports interesting types of motifs with minimal additional cost; and (iv) is optimized for a variety of architectures such as multi-core systems, clusters in the cloud, and supercomputers. ACME reduces the extraction time for an exact-length query from 4 hours to 7 minutes on a typical workstation; handles 3 orders of magnitude longer sequences; and scales up to 16, 384 cores on a supercomputer.

	abstract = {Temporal data mining techniques are important addition to the field of demand forecasting and stock optimization especially in health applications like drug stock optimization in public clinics. Optimizing drug stock amounts saves a substantial amount of money while maintaining the same level of health service. This paper introduces an enhancement of the temporal pattern matching algorithm as one of the temporal data mining techniques. The enhancement is in the form of replacing the human intuition in selecting the patterns being matched (against the last pattern of arbitrary length of the investigated time series) by systematically searching for them in historical data. The search process is done by applying time series motif discovery algorithm to obtain the set of most similar patterns to the last pattern in the time series. The proposed algorithm also integrates an outlier removal procedure to overcome the expected dispersion of the forecast values due to the probable big number of returned patterns from the motif discovery step. These additions to the temporal pattern matching algorithm improve the quality of patterns being matched and improve the overall forecasting accuracy. The key idea of our algorithm is that it simultaneously performs the pattern matching task - as a necessary step for demand forecasting - while discovering the most similar patterns in historical data. The proposed algorithm is useful if the investigated drug is new and does not have a long enough history to make demand forecast using the ordinary statistical methods. Experimental results show that the time series prediction using this method is more accurate than the traditional prediction methods especially in the cases of new drugs that do not have enough history to make future consumption prediction.},

	abstract = {Background: Modeling dynamic regulatory networks is a major challenge since much of the protein-DNA interaction data available is static. The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) uses a Hidden Markov Model-based approach to integrate this static interaction data with time series gene expression leading to models that can determine when transcription factors (TFs) activate genes and what genes they regulate. DREM has been used successfully in diverse areas of biological research. However, several issues were not addressed by the original version.Results: DREM 2.0 is a comprehensive software for reconstructing dynamic regulatory networks that supports interactive graphical or batch mode. With version 2.0 a set of new features that are unique in comparison with other softwares are introduced. First, we provide static interaction data for additional species. Second, DREM 2.0 now accepts continuous binding values and we added a new method to utilize TF expression levels when searching for dynamic models. Third, we added support for discriminative motif discovery, which is particularly powerful for species with limited experimental interaction data. Finally, we improved the visualization to support the new features. Combined, these changes improve the ability of DREM 2.0 to accurately recover dynamic regulatory networks and make it much easier to use it for analyzing such networks in several species with varying degrees of interaction information.Conclusions: DREM 2.0 provides a unique framework for constructing and visualizing dynamic regulatory networks.

	abstract = {Predicting the sub-cellular localization of proteins is an important task in bioinformatics, for which many standard prediction tools are available. While these tools are powerful in general and capable of predicting protein localization for the most common compartments, their performance strongly depends on the organism of interest. More importantly, there are special compartments, such as the apicoplast of apicomplexan parasites, for which these tools cannot provide a prediction at all. In the absence of a highly conserved targeting signal, even motif searches may not be able to provide a lead for the accurate prediction of protein localization for a compartment of interest. In order to approach difficult cases of that kind, we propose an alternative method that complements existing approaches by using a more targeted protein sequence model. Moreover, our method makes use of (weighted) measures for time series comparison. To demonstrate its performance, we use this method for predicting localization in special compartments of three different species, for which existing methods yield only sub-optimal results. As shown experimentally, our method is indeed capable of producing reliable predictions of sub-cellular localization for difficult cases, i.e. if training data is scarce and a potential protein targeting signal may not be well conserved. © 2014 Imperial College Press.},

It is assumed that a set of event sequences has been collected from an application, where each event has an id and an occurrence time. Our work is motivated by the observation that in practice many associated events in multiple temporal sequences do not occur concurrently but sequentially. We proposed a two-phase method, called Multivariate Association Miner (MAM). In an empirical study, we apply MAM to two different application domains. Firstly, we use our method to detect multivariate motifs from multiple time series data. Existing approaches are all limited by assuming that the univariate elements of a multivariate motif occur completely or approximately synchronously. The experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show that our method not only discovers synchronous motifs, but also finds non-synchronous multivariate motifs. Secondly, we apply MAM to mine frequent episodes from event streams. Current methods are all limited by requiring users to either provide possible lengths of frequent episodes or specify an inter-event time constraint for every pair of successive event types in an episode. The results on neuronal spike simulation data show that MAM automatically detects episodes with variable time delays. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {During the cell cycle, the levels of hundreds of mRNAs change in a periodic manner, but how this is achieved by alterations in the rates of mRNA synthesis and degradation has not been studied systematically. Here, we used metabolic RNA labeling and comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis (cDTA) to derive mRNA synthesis and degradation rates every 5 min during three cell cycle periods of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A novel statistical model identified 479 genes that show periodic changes in mRNA synthesis and generally also periodic changes in their mRNA degradation rates. Peaks of mRNA degradation generally follow peaks of mRNA synthesis, resulting in sharp and high peaks of mRNA levels at defined times during the cell cycle. Whereas the timing of mRNA synthesis is set by upstream DNA motifs and their associated transcription factors (TFs), the synthesis rate of a periodically expressed gene is apparently set by its core promoter. Synopsis Genome-scale measurement of changes in mRNA synthesis and degradation rates during the yeast cell cycle identifies genes with periodic synthesis and degradation and reveals a tight temporal coupling of both processes. The first high-resolution time series of mRNA synthesis and degradation rates during the cell cycle is presented. A novel statistical algorithm identifies periodically expressed genes and parameters of their temporal profile. The timing of periodic expression is set by upstream DNA motifs and the associated transcription factors, whereas the synthesis rate is set by the core promoter. Sharp and high peaks of mRNA levels are obtained by a temporal coupling of periodic mRNA synthesis and degradation maxima. The dynamic mRNA synthesis and degradation during the cell cycle is monitored by metabolic mRNA labeling. Statistical modeling identifies genes with periodic synthesis and degradation and reveals a tight temporal coupling of both processes. © 2014 The Authors.},

Second, we look for a time series data based on these motifs by QoM.

Meanwhile, in the process of searching time series, we also can further understand the specific time series by the motif which represents a characteristic pattern in the time series database.

	abstract = {Motivation: Feedback circuits are crucial network motifs, ubiquitously found in many intra- and inter-cellular regulatory networks, and also act as basic building blocks for inducing synchronized bursting behaviors in neural network dynamics. Therefore, the system-level identification of feedback circuits using time-series measurements is critical to understand the underlying regulatory mechanism of synchronized bursting behaviors.Results: Multi-Step Granger Causality Method (MSGCM) was developed to identify feedback loops embedded in biological networks using time-series experimental measurements. Based on multivariate time-series analysis, MSGCM used a modified Wald test to infer the existence of multi-step Granger causality between a pair of network nodes. A significant bi-directional multi-step Granger causality between two nodes indicated the existence of a feedback loop. This new identification method resolved the drawback of the previous non-causal impulse response component method which was only applicable to networks containing no co-regulatory forward path. MSGCM also significantly improved the ratio of correct identification of feedback loops. In this study, the MSGCM was testified using synthetic pulsed neural network models and also in vitro cultured rat neural networks using multi-electrode array. As a result, we found a large number of feedback loops in the in vitro cultured neural networks with apparent synchronized oscillation, indicating a close relationship between synchronized oscillatory bursting behavior and underlying feedback loops. The MSGCM is an efficient method to investigate feedback loops embedded in in vitro cultured neural networks. The identified feedback loop motifs are considered as an important design principle responsible for the synchronized bursting behavior in neural networks. © The Author (2012).

In this paper, we develop a new method for motif discovery in streaming time series. In this method we use significant extreme points to determine motif candidates and then cluster motif candidates by BIRCH algorithm.

As we can't expect the pattern to be exact matching copies owing to biological mutations, the motif finding turns to be more complex. There are different types of motifs like Planted (l, d), Gapped, Time Series and Network Motifs. In this paper, we adopt the features of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to solve Planted (l, d)-Motifs and then Gapped Motifs. PSO is a global approximation optimization technique and has wide applications. It finds the global best solution by simply adjusting the trajectory of each individual towards its own best location and towards the best particle of the swarm at each generation. We have performed experiments first on simulated Planted (l, d)-Motifs with challenging instances. Secondly, we have tested our algorithm to identify the Gapped Motifs. Our approach is also able to detect known gapped TFBS's more accurately and more efficiently when gaps are consecutive and are located in the centre of a motif.},

	abstract = {Spodoptera litura nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpltMNPV) vp39 (Spltvp39) is one of the 37 core genes identified in all sequenced baculovirus genomes. The open reading frame of Spltvp39 is 909 bp in length, which encodes 302 amino acids with predicted molecular weight of 33.9 kDa. Homology analysis indicated that SpltVP39 protein has 20-67% amino acid identity with those of other known baculoviruses. Amino acid sequence alignment of SpltVP39 homologs showed 6 highly conserved cysteine residues. In this study, the rabbit polyclonal SpltVP39 antiserum was prepared. Spltvp39 transcription in SpltMNPV-infected SpLi-221 cells was first detected at 12 h post-infection (p.i.), and reached the maximal level at 96 h p.i.. The transcriptional start sites of mRNA were mapped within 3 consensus baculovirus late promoter motifs ATAAG. Time course analysis of SpltVP39 expression in SpltMNPV-infected cells showed that SpltVP39 was expressed from 24 through 96 h p.i. as a 33.9 kDa protein. Western blotting indicated that this protein appeared in the nucleocapsids of both occlusion-derived virions and budded virions. These results demonstrate that the Spltvp39 should be classified as a baculovirus late gene similar to most other baculovirus late structural genes.},

Second, we introduce our time series motif discovery algorithm to excavate the hidden motifs from the time series of color face images. Third, we find the relationship among these generated time series. At last, experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithm, and we can safely draw a conclusion that our approach in the face recognition field is valid and successfully realizes the face image recognition from a new perspective. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Quantifying the algorithmic information content of hand motion patterns during a surgical task enables the comparison of different groups, novice and expert. Previously, we have shown that the information content/complexity of hand motion patterns during the surgical skill/subtask of knot tying reduces with increased expertise (J Surg Educ 2012;69:306-310). We therefore hypothesized that the information content/complexity of motion patterns would also reduce with expertise during a more complex surgical task of a bench model venous anastomosis. Methods: A custom inertial measurement unit was used to record 6-degrees of freedom hand motion from the right hand during a low-fidelity bench model venous anastomosis. Data were obtained from 2 groups as follows: novice (surgical residents, postgraduate year 1 and 2) and expert (attending surgeons). Each data set from the surgical task was processed into a symbolic time series from which the algorithmic entropy measure Lempel-Ziv complexity was calculated. A Student t test was used to test whether the 2 groups were sampled from the same population when using this metric, applying a P value of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis. Results: The expert surgeons had more complex patterns of motion compared with novice surgeons during this surgical task. This was statistically significant using the Lempel-Ziv complexity metric (P = 0.01). Conclusions: The hypothesis that increased surgical experience would reduce the complexity of hand motion patterns was not found to be true during this surgical task, and the opposite was found to be true. An alternative hypothesis that would combine the previous finding of a reduction in complexity of a subtask with this study's finding of increasing complexity of the whole task with increasing surgical expertise could be due to a hierarchy of pattern structure: experts use simpler subtask motifs in more complex and denser patterns.

The almost of studies for network identification focused on the improvement of computational efficiency in large-scale network inference of complex system with cyclic relations and few attempted have been done for answering practical problem occurred in real biological systems. In this study, we focused to evaluate inferring performance of our previously proposed method for inferring biological network on simple network motifs. Results: We evaluated the network inferring accuracy and efficiency of our previously proposed network inferring algorithm, by using 6 kinds of repeated appearance of highly significant network motifs in the regulatory network of E. coli proposed by Shen-Orr et al and Herrgård et al, and 2 kinds of network motif in S. cerevisiae proposed by Lee et. al. As a result, our method could reconstruct about 40% of interactions in network motif from time-series data set. Moreover the introduction of time-series data of one-factor disrupted model could remarkably improved the performance of network inference. Conclusions: The results of network inference examination of E. coli network motif shows that our network inferring algorithm was able to apply to typical topology of biological network. A continuous examination of inferring well established network motif in biology would strengthen the applicability of our algorithm to the realistic biological network. © 2013 Nakatsui et al.},

	abstract = {Algorithms searching for similar patterns are widely used in seismology both when the waveforms of the events of interest are known and when there is no a priori-knowledge. Such methods usually make use of the cross-correlation coefficient as a measure of similarity; if there is no a-priori knowledge, they behave as brute-force searching algorithms. The disadvantage of these methods, preventing or limiting their application to very large datasets, is computational complexity. The Mueen-Keogh (MK) algorithm overcomes this limitation by means of two optimization techniques-the early abandoning concept and space indexing. Here, we apply the MK algorithm to amplitude time series retrieved from seismic signals recorded during episodic eruptive activity of Mt Etna in 2011. By adequately tuning the input to the MK algorithm we found eight motif groups characterized by distinct seismic amplitude trends, each related to a different phenomenon. In particular, we observed that earthquakes are accompanied by sharp increases and decreases in seismic amplitude whereas lava fountains are accompanied by slower changes. These results demonstrate that the MK algorithm, because of its particular features, may have wide applicability in seismology. © 2012 Springer Basel AG.},

	abstract = {An electroencephalographic (EEG) waveform could be denoted by a series of ordinal patterns called motifs which are based on the ranking values of subsequence time series. Permutation entropy (PE) has been developed to describe the relative occurrence of each of these motifs. However, PE has few limitations, mainly its inability to differentiate between distinct patterns of a certain motif, and its sensitivity to noise. To minimize those limitations, Weighted-Permutation Entropy (WPE) was proposed as a modification version of PE to improve complexity measuring for times series. This paper presents an approach by incorporating WPE into the analysis of different physiological states namely EEG time series. Three different EEG physiological states, eye-closed (EC), eye-open (EO), and visual oddball task (VOT) were included to examine ability of WPE to identify and discriminate different physiological states. The classification using WPE has achieved the results with accuracy of 87% between EC and EO states, and 83% between EO and VOT, respectively, using linear discrimination analysis. The results showed the potential of WPE to be a promising feature for nonlinear analysis in different physiological states of brain. It was also observed that WPE also could be used as marker for large artifact with low frequency such as eye-blink. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Most growth factor receptors trigger phosphorylation-based signal transduction to translate environmental stimuli into defined biological responses. In addition to comprehensive and reliable assessment of growth factor-induced phosphoregulation, temporal resolution is needed to gain insights into the organizing principles of the cellular signaling machinery. Here, we introduce a refined experimental design for MS-based phosphoproteomics to reconcile the need for high comprehensiveness and temporal resolution with the key requirement of monitoring biological reproducibility. We treated SILAC-labeled SCC-9 cells with the seven transmembrane receptor ligand lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and identified more than 17 000 phosphorylation sites. Filtering for biological replicate quantification yielded five-time point profiles for 6292 site-specific phosphorylations, which we analyzed for statistically significant regulation. Notably, about 30% of these sites changed significantly upon LPA stimulation, indicating extensive phosphoproteome regulation in response to this growth factor. Analysis of time series data identified distinct temporal profiles for different kinase substrate motifs, likely reflecting temporal orchestration of cellular kinase activities. Our data further indicated coordinated regulation of biological processes and phosphoprotein networks upon LPA stimulation. Finally, we detected regulation of functionally characterized phosphorylation sites not yet implicated in LPA signaling, which may foster a better understanding how LPA regulates cellular physiology on the molecular level. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Despite successes in speedup of motif discovery algorithms, most of the existing algorithms still require predefined parameters. The critical and most cumbersome one is time series motif length since it is difficult to manually determine the proper length of the motifs-even for the domain experts. In addition, with variability in the motif lengths, ranking among these motifs becomes another major problem. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm using compression ratio as a heuristic to discover meaningful motifs in proper lengths. The ranking of these various length motifs relies on an ability to compress time series by its own motif as a hypothesis. Furthermore, other than being an anytime algorithm, our experimental evaluation also demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms existing works in various domains both in terms of speed and accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.},

This is done through a three step process, where ICU time series are first discretized into sequences of symbols (by segmenting and partitioning them into periods of low, medium and high measurements); the resulting sequences of symbols are then searched for short subsequences that are associated with in-hospital mortality; and the information in many such clinically useful subsequences is integrated into models that can assess new patients.

	abstract = {Background: Network inference of gene expression data is an important challenge in systems biology. Novel algorithms may provide more detailed gene regulatory networks (GRN) for complex, chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in which activated synovial fibroblasts (SFBs) play a major role. Since the detailed mechanisms underlying this activation are still unclear, simultaneous investigation of multi-stimuli activation of SFBs offers the possibility to elucidate the regulatory effects of multiple mediators and to gain new insights into disease pathogenesis. Methods. A GRN was therefore inferred from RA-SFBs treated with 4 different stimuli (IL-1 β, TNF, TGF- β, and PDGF-D). Data from time series microarray experiments (0, 1, 2, 4, 12 h; Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0) were batch-corrected applying 'ComBat', analyzed for differentially expressed genes over time with 'Limma', and used for the inference of a robust GRN with NetGenerator V2.0, a heuristic ordinary differential equation-based method with soft integration of prior knowledge. Results: Using all genes differentially expressed over time in RA-SFBs for any stimulus, and selecting the genes belonging to the most significant gene ontology (GO) term, i.e., 'cartilage development', a dynamic, robust, moderately complex multi-stimuli GRN was generated with 24 genes and 57 edges in total, 31 of which were gene-to-gene edges. Prior literature-based knowledge derived from Pathway Studio or manual searches was reflected in the final network by 25/57 confirmed edges (44%). The model contained known network motifs crucial for dynamic cellular behavior, e.g., cross-talk among pathways, positive feed-back loops, and positive feed-forward motifs (including suppression of the transcriptional repressor OSR2 by all 4 stimuli. Conclusion: A multi-stimuli GRN highly concordant with literature data was successfully generated by network inference from the gene expression of stimulated RA-SFBs. The GRN showed high reliability, since 10 predicted edges were independently validated by literature findings post network inference. The selected GO term 'cartilage development' contained a number of differentiation markers, growth factors, and transcription factors with potential relevance for RA. Finally, the model provided new insight into the response of RA-SFBs to multiple stimuli implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, in particular to the 'novel' potent growth factor PDGF-D. © 2014 Kupfer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Elucidating the dynamics of molecular processes in living organisms in response to external perturbations is a central goal in modern systems biology. We investigated the dynamics of protein phosphorylation events in Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to changing nutrient conditions. Phosphopeptide expression levels were detected at five consecutive time points over a time interval of 30min after nutrient resupply following prior starvation. The three tested inorganic, ionic nutrients NH4+, NO3-, PO43- elicited similar phosphosignaling responses that were distinguishable from those invoked by the sugars mannitol, sucrose. When embedded in the protein-protein interaction network of Arabidopsis thaliana, phosphoproteins were found to exhibit a higher degree compared to average proteins. Based on the time-series data, we reconstructed a network of regulatory interactions mediated by phosphorylation. The performance of different network inference methods was evaluated by the observed likelihood of physical interactions within and across different subcellular compartments and based on gene ontology semantic similarity. The dynamic phosphorylation network was then reconstructed using a Pearson correlation method with added directionality based on partial variance differences. The topology of the inferred integrated network corresponds to an information dissemination architecture, in which the phosphorylation signal is passed on to an increasing number of phosphoproteins stratified into an initiation, processing, and effector layer. Specific phosphorylation peptide motifs associated with the distinct layers were identified indicating the action of layer-specific kinases. Despite the limited temporal resolution, combined with information on subcellular location, the available time-series data proved useful for reconstructing the dynamics of the molecular signaling cascade in response to nutrient stress conditions in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. © 2013 Duan, Walther and Schulze.},

	abstract = {Background: Prednisone, one of the most highly prescribed drugs, has well characterized effects on gene transcription mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. These effects are typically occurring on the scale of hours. Prednisone also has a number of non-transcriptional effects (occurring on minutes scale) on protein signaling, yet these are less well studied. We sought to expand the understanding of acute effects of prednisone action on cell signaling using a combination of SILAC strategy and subcellular fractionations from C2 C12 myotubes. Results: De novo translation of proteins was inhibited in both SILAC labeled and unlabeled C2C12 myotubes. Unlabeled cells were exposed to prednisone while SILAC labeled cells remained untreated. After 0, 5, 15, and 30 minutes of prednisone exposure, labeled and unlabeled cells were mixed at 1:1 ratios and fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions. A total of 534 proteins in the cytosol and 626 proteins in the nucleus were identified and quantitated, using 3 or more peptides per protein with peptide based probability ≤ 0.001. We identified significant increases (1.7- to 3.1- fold) in cytoplasmic abundance of 11 ribosomal proteins within 5 minutes of exposure, all of which returned to baseline by 30 min. We hypothesized that these drug-induced acute changes in the subcellular localization of the cell's protein translational machinery could lead to altered translation of quiescent RNAs. To test this, de novo protein synthesis was assayed after 15 minutes of drug exposure. Quantitative fluorography identified 16 2D gel spots showing rapid changes in translation; five of these were identified by MS/MS (pyruvate kinase, annexin A6 isoform A and isoform B, nasopharyngeal epithelium specific protein 1, and isoform 2 of Replication factor C subunit 1), and all showed the 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine motifs associated with mRNA sequestration to and from inactive mRNA pools. Conclusion: We describe novel approaches of subcellular proteomic profiling and assessment of acute changes on a minute-based time scale. These data expand the current knowledge of acute, non-transcriptional activities of glucocorticoids, including changes in protein subcellular localization, altered translation of quiescent RNA pools, and PKC-mediated cytoskeleton remodeling. © 2009 Reeves et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {A key problem in understanding transcriptional regulatory networks is deciphering what cis regulatory logic is encoded in gene promoter sequences and how this sequence information maps to expression. A typical computational approach to this problem involves clustering genes by their expression profiles and then searching for overrepresented motifs in the promoter sequences of genes in a cluster. However, genes with similar expression profiles may be controlled by distinct regulatory programs. Moreover, if many gene expression profiles in a data set are highly correlated, as in the case of whole organism developmental time series, it may be difficult to resolve fine-grained clusters in the first place. We present a predictive framework for modeling the natural flow of information, from promoter sequence to expression, to learn cis regulatory motifs and characterize gene expression patterns in developmental time courses. We introduce a cluster-free algorithm based on a graph-regularized version of partial least squares (PLS) regression to learn sequence patterns-represented by graphs of k-mers, or "graph-mers"-that predict gene expression trajectories. Applying the approach to wildtype germline development in Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that the first and second latent PLS factors mapped to expression profiles for oocyte and sperm genes, respectively. We extracted both known and novel motifs from the graphmers associated to these germline-specific patterns, including novel CG-rich motifs specific to oocyte genes. We found evidence supporting the functional relevance of these putative regulatory elements through analysis of positional bias, motif conservation and in situ gene expression. This study demonstrates that our regression model can learn biologically meaningful latent structure and identify potentially functional motifs from subtle developmental time course expression data. © 2010 Li et al.},

	abstract = {Complex networks have been characterised by their specific connectivity patterns (network motifs), but their building blocks can also be identified and described by node-motifs-a combination of local network features. One technique to identify single node-motifs has been presented by Costa et al. (L. D. F. Costa, F. A. Rodrigues, C. C. Hilgetag, and M. Kaiser, Europhys. Lett., 87, 1, 2009). Here, we first suggest improvements to the method including how its parameters can be determined automatically. Such automatic routines make high-throughput studies of many networks feasible. Second, the new routines are validated in different network-series. Third, we provide an example of how the method can be used to analyse network time-series. In conclusion, we provide a robust method for systematically discovering and classifying characteristic nodes of a network. In contrast to classical motif analysis, our approach can identify individual components (Here: Nodes) that are specific to a network. Such special nodes, as hubs before, might be found to play critical roles in realworld networks. © 2011 Echtermeyer et al.},

	abstract = {The existing tools for estimating the risk of death in patients after they experience acute coronary syndrome are commonly based on echocardiography and clinical risk scores (for example, the TIMI risk score). These identify a small group of high-risk patients who account for only a minority of the deaths that occur in patients after acute coronary syndrome. Here, we investigated the use of three computationally generated cardiac biomarkers for risk stratification in this population: morphologic variability (MV), symbolic mismatch (SM), and heart rate motifs (HRM). We derived these biomarkers from time-series analyses of continuous electrocardiographic data collected from patients in the TIMI-DISPERSE2 clinical trial through machine learning and data mining methods designed to extract information that is difficult to visualize directly in these data. We evaluated these biomarkers in a blinded, prespecified, and fully automated study on more than 4500 patients in the MERLIN-TIMI36 (Metabolic Efficiency with Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 36) clinical trial. Our results showed a strong association between all three computationally generated cardiac biomarkers and cardiovascular death in the MERLIN-TIMI36 trial over a 2-year period after acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, the information in each of these biomarkers was independent of the information in the others and independent of the information provided by existing clinical risk scores, electrocardiographic metrics, and echocardiography. The addition of MV, SM, and HRM to existing metrics significantly improved model discrimination, as well as the precision and recall of prediction rules based on left ventricular ejection fraction. These biomarkers can be extracted from data that are routinely captured from patients with acute coronary syndrome and will allow for more accurate risk stratification and potentially for better patient treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: Comprehensively understanding corticosteroid pharmacogenomic effects is an essential step towards an insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms for both beneficial and detrimental clinical effects. Nevertheless, even in a single tissue different methods of corticosteroid administration can induce different patterns of expression and regulatory control structures. Therefore, rich in vivo datasets of pharmacological time-series with two dosing regimens sampled from rat liver are examined for temporal patterns of changes in gene expression and their regulatory commonalities.Results: The study addresses two issues, including (1) identifying significant transcriptional modules coupled with dynamic expression patterns and (2) predicting relevant common transcriptional controls to better understand the underlying mechanisms of corticosteroid adverse effects. Following the orientation of meta-analysis, an extended computational approach that explores the concept of agreement matrix from consensus clustering has been proposed with the aims of identifying gene clusters that share common expression patterns across multiple dosing regimens as well as handling challenges in the analysis of microarray data from heterogeneous sources, e.g. different platforms and time-grids in this study. Six significant transcriptional modules coupled with typical patterns of expression have been identified. Functional analysis reveals that virtually all enriched functions (gene ontologies, pathways) in these modules are shown to be related to metabolic processes, implying the importance of these modules in adverse effects under the administration of corticosteroids. Relevant putative transcriptional regulators (e.g. RXRF, FKHD, SP1F) are also predicted to provide another source of information towards better understanding the complexities of expression patterns and the underlying regulatory mechanisms of those modules.Conclusions: We have proposed a framework to identify significant coexpressed clusters of genes across multiple conditions experimented from different microarray platforms, time-grids, and also tissues if applicable. Analysis on rich in vivo datasets of corticosteroid time-series yielded significant insights into the pharmacogenomic effects of corticosteroids, especially the relevance to metabolic side-effects. This has been illustrated through enriched metabolic functions in those transcriptional modules and the presence of GRE binding motifs in those enriched pathways, providing significant modules for further analysis on pharmacogenomic corticosteroid effects. © 2010 Nguyen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Time series are composed of sequences of data items measured at typically uniform intervals. Time series arise frequently in many scientific and engineering applications, including finance, medicine, digital audio, and motion capture. Time series motifs are repeated similar subseries in one or multiple time series data. Time series anomalies are unusual subseries in one or multiple time series data. Finding motifs and anomalies in time series data are closely related problems and are useful in many domains, including medicine, motion capture, meteorology, and finance. This paper presents a novel approach for both the motif discovery problem and the anomaly detection problem. First, we use a subseries join operation to match similar subseries and to obtain similarity relationships among subseries of the time series data. The subseries join algorithm we use can efficiently and effectively tolerate noise, time-scaling, and phase shifts. Based on the similarity relationships found among subseries of the time series data, the motif discovery and anomaly detection problems can be converted to graph-theoretic problems solvable by known graph-theoretic algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to discover motifs and anomalies in real-world time series data. Experiments also demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient when applied to large time series datasets. © Copyright International Association of Engineers.},

In this paper, an efficient HMM-based similarity search scheme is proposed with an innovative training algorithm using small size of training data composed of only distinct subsequences, which is very useful for the metamaterial design. Experiment results show that the training time of our method can be reduced extremely to 1% of that of conventional methods.

We present an exact algorithm that makes use of the order line concept and the subsequence matching property of the normalized time series to find all motifs of various lengths. We also describe a method called LPMiner to discover lagPatterns efficiently. LPMiner utilizes inverted index and motif alignment technique to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency. A detailed empirical study on synthetic datasets shows the scalability of the proposed approach.

However, it is difficult to discover and visualize these motifs as their numbers increase, especially in large multivariate time series. To find frequent motifs, we use several temporal data mining and event encoding techniques to cluster and convert a multivariate time series to a sequence of events. Then we quantify the efficiency of the discovered motifs by linking them with a performance metric. To visualize frequent patterns in a large time series with potentially hundreds of nested motifs on a single display, we introduce three novel visual analytics methods: (1) motif layout, using colored rectangles for visualizing the occurrences and hierarchical relationships of motifs in a multivariate time series, (2) motif distortion, for enlarging or shrinking motifs as appropriate for easy analysis and (3) motif merging, to combine a number of identical adjacent motif instances without cluttering the display. Analysts can interactively optimize the degree of distortion and merging to get the best possible view. A specific motif (e.g., the most efficient or least efficient motif) can be quickly detected from a large time series for further investigation. We have applied these methods to two real-world data sets: data center cooling and oil well production. The results provide important new insights into the recurring patterns. © 2011 SPIE-IS&T.},

In particular, we construct from measured time series phase-space complex networks and then calculate the distribution of a set of distinct network motifs. To gain insight, we first test the approach using time series from classical chaotic systems and find a universal feature: motif distributions from different chaotic systems are generally highly heterogeneous. Our main finding is that the distributions from experimental two-phase flows tend to be heterogeneous as well, suggesting the underlying chaotic nature of the flow patterns. Calculation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent provides further support for this. Motif distributions can thus be a feasible tool to understand the dynamics of realistic two-phase flow patterns. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

The model's robustness is first validated on synthetic data. It is then applied on a large set of video data from state-of-the-art papers. We show that it can effectively recover temporal activities with high semantics for humans and strong temporal information.

Our approach and methodology will be applied to data that have been observe from daily consumption of electricity for more than two years indicating periodicity at weekly, monthly and yearly levels having multiple periodicity.

	abstract = {Motivation: Data centers are a critical component of modern IT infrastructure but are also among the worst environmental oenders through their increasing energy usage and the resulting large carbon footprints. Efficient management of data centers, including power management, networking, and cooling infrastructure, is hence crucial to sustainability. In the absence of a "first-principles" approach to manage these complex components and their interactions, data-driven approaches have become attractive and tenable. Results: We present a temporal data mining solution to model and optimize performance of data center chillers, a key component of the cooling infrastructure. It helps bridge raw, numeric, time-series information from sensor streams toward higher level characterizations of chiller behavior, suitable for a data center engineer. To aid in this transduction, temporal data streams are first encoded into a symbolic representation, next run-length encoded segments are mined to form frequent motifs in time series, and finally these metrics are evaluated by their contributions to sustainability. A key innovation in our application is the ability to intersperse "don't care" transitions (e.g., transients) in continuous-valued time series data, an advantage we inherit by the application of frequent episode mining to symbolized representations of numeric time series. Our approach provides both qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the sensor streams to the data center engineer, to aid him in tuning chiller operating characteristics. This system is currently being prototyped for a data center managed by HP and experimental results from this application reveal the promise of our approach. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

We propose a novel approach based on grammar induction that allows the discovery of approximate, variable-length motifs in streaming data.

	abstract = {For one of the most common network motifs, an inhibitory neuron pair, we perform an extensive study of burst synchronization and the related phenomena applying the model of Rulkov maps coupled via delayed synapses. Instigated by the phase-plane analysis, that has the neuron switching between the noninteracting and the interacting map, it is demonstrated how the system evolution may be interpreted by means of the dynamical configurations of the motif, each represented by an extracted subgraph. Under the variation of the synaptic parameters, the probability of finding synchronized neurons in a given configuration is seen to reflect the way in which the anti-phase synchronization is eventually superseded by the synchronization in phase. Such an approach also provides a novel insight into regularization, characterizing the neuron bursting in either of these regimes. Looking into correlation of the two neurons' bursting cycles we acquire a deeper understanding of the more sophisticated mechanisms by which the regularity in the time series is maintained. Further, it is examined whether introducing heterogeneity in the neuron or the synaptic parameters may prove advantageous over the homogeneous case with respect to burst synchronization. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years there has been significant research effort spent on efficiently discovering these motifs in static offline databases. However, for many domains, the inherent streaming nature of time series demands online discovery and maintenance of time series motifs. In this paper, we develop the first online motif discovery algorithm which monitors and maintains motifs exactly in real time over the most recent history of a stream. Our algorithm has a worst-case update time which is linear to the window size and is extendible to maintain more complex pattern structures. In contrast, the current offline algorithms either need significant update time or require very costly pre-processing steps which online algorithms simply cannot afford. Our core ideas allow useful extensions of our algorithm to deal with arbitrary data rates and discovering multidimensional motifs. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms with a variety of case studies in the domains of robotics, acoustic monitoring and online compression. © 2010 ACM.},

	abstract = {Subspace clustering is an established mining task for grouping objects that are represented by vector data. By considering subspace projections of the data, the problem of full-space clustering is avoided: objects show no similarity w.r.t. all of their attributes but only w.r.t. subsets of their characteristics. This effect is not limited to vector data but can be observed in several other scientific domains including graphs, where we just find similar subgraphs, or time series, where only shorter subsequences show the same behavior. In each scenario, using the whole representation of the objects for clustering is futile. We need to find clusters of similar substructures. However, none of the existing substructure mining paradigms as subspace clustering, frequent subgraph mining, or motif discovery is able to solve this task entirely since they tackle only a few challenges and are restricted to a specific type of data. In this work, we unify and generalize existing substructure mining tasks to the novel paradigm of substructure clustering that is applicable to data of an arbitrary type. As a proof of concept showing the feasibility of our novel paradigm, we present a specific instantiation for the task of subgraph clustering. By integrating the ideas of different research areas into a novel paradigm, the aim of our paper is to inspire future research directions in the individual areas. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

In this paper, a new motif discovery algorithm is proposed that has the advantage of requiring no upper limit on the motif length.

Since many of the dimensions of the data are known or suspected to be irrelevant, our approach first identifies the salient dimensions of the data, then the key temporal motifs within each dimension, and finally the temporal ordering of the motifs necessary for prediction. For the prediction element, the data are assumed to be labeled. We tested the approach on two real-world data sets. To verify the generality of the approach, we validated the application on several subjects from the CMU Motion Capture database. Our main application uses several hundred numerically simulated supercell thunderstorms where the goal is to identify the most important features and feature interrelationships which herald the development of strong rotation in the lowest altitudes of a storm. We identified sets of precursors, in the form of meteorological quantities reaching extreme values in a particular temporal sequence, unique to storms producing strong low-altitude rotation. The eventual goal is to use this knowledge for future severe weather detection and prediction algorithms. © 2010 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Motivation: Synchronized bursting behavior is a remarkable phenomenon in neural dynamics. So, identification of the underlying functional structure is crucial to understand its regulatory mechanism at a system level. On the other hand, we noted that feedback loops (FBLs) are commonly used basic building blocks in engineering circuit design, especially for synchronization, and they have also been considered as important regulatory network motifs in systems biology. From these motivations, we have investigated the relationship between synchronized bursting behavior and feedback motifs in neural networks. Results: Through extensive simulations of synthetic spike oscillation models, we found that a particular structure of FBLs, coupled direct and indirect positive feedback loops (PFLs), can induce robust synchronized bursting behaviors. To further investigate this, we have developed a novel FBL identification method based on sampled time-series data and applied it to synchronized spiking records measured from cultured neural networks of rat by using multi-electrode array. As a result, we have identified coupled direct and indirect PFLs. Conclusion: We therefore conclude that coupled direct and indirect PFLs might be an important design principle that causes the synchronized bursting behavior in neuronal networks although an extrapolation of this result to in vivo brain dynamics still remains an unanswered question. © The Author 2009.

	abstract = {Instigated by the research on clusterization phenomena in complex neural networks, we study a triplet of bursting Rulkov map neurons connected via inhibitory synapses with delay. It is demonstrated how on a background of structural motif one can build different types of functional circuits. The approach is based on utilizing the properties of the chemical synapses, whose gating is modeled by the fast threshold modulation, in conjunction with the phase plane analysis, allowing the system state to be represented in terms of maps the neurons reside on. For both the dynamical configurations, monitoring the layout of active neurons, and the functional motifs, following the maps where the synchronized neurons lie, we establish a one-on-one correspondence between sequences in the time series and the triads, making up the subgraphs of the original graph. By introducing the appropriate sets of quantities, one obtains not only the distributions of triads as a function of synaptic parameters, but is also able to identify a distinct triad whose presence may be viewed as a signature of the burst synchronization process. In another setup, the regularization of burst cycles for an arbitrary neuron is explained by classifying all the bursts as long or short, with their fractions linked to the abundances of triads under variation of synaptic parameters. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Anatomic connections between brain areas affect information flow between neuronal circuits and the synchronization of neuronal activity. However, such structural connectivity does not coincide with effective connectivity (or, more precisely, causal connectivity), related to the elusive question "Which areas cause the present activity of which others?". Effective connectivity is directed and depends flexibly on contexts and tasks. Here we show that dynamic effective connectivity can emerge from transitions in the collective organization of coherent neural activity. Integrating simulation and semi-analytic approaches, we study mesoscale network motifs of interacting cortical areas, modeled as large random networks of spiking neurons or as simple rate units. Through a causal analysis of time-series of model neural activity, we show that different dynamical states generated by a same structural connectivity motif correspond to distinct effective connectivity motifs. Such effective motifs can display a dominant directionality, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking and effective entrainment between local brain rhythms, although all connections in the considered structural motifs are reciprocal. We show then that transitions between effective connectivity configurations (like, for instance, reversal in the direction of inter-areal interactions) can be triggered reliably by brief perturbation inputs, properly timed with respect to an ongoing local oscillation, without the need for plastic synaptic changes. Finally, we analyze how the information encoded in spiking patterns of a local neuronal population is propagated across a fixed structural connectivity motif, demonstrating that changes in the active effective connectivity regulate both the efficiency and the directionality of information transfer. Previous studies stressed the role played by coherent oscillations in establishing efficient communication between distant areas. Going beyond these early proposals, we advance here that dynamic interactions between brain rhythms provide as well the basis for the self-organized control of this "communication-through-coherence", making thus possible a fast "on-demand" reconfiguration of global information routing modalities. © 2012 Battaglia et al.},

	abstract = {Continuous time series data often comprise or contain repeated motifs - patterns that have similar shape, and yet exhibit nontrivial variability. Identifying these motifs, even in the presence of variation, is an important subtask in both unsupervised knowledge discovery and constructing useful features for discriminative tasks. This paper addresses this task using a probabilistic framework that models generation of data as switching between a random walk state and states that generate motifs. A motif is generated from a continuous shape template that can undergo non-linear transformations such as temporal warping and additive noise. We propose an unsupervised algorithm that simultaneously discovers both the set of canonical shape templates and a template-specific model of variability manifested in the data. Experimental results on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our model is able to recover templates in data where repeated instances show large variability. The recovered templates provide higher classification accuracy and coverage when compared to those from alternatives such as random projection based methods and simpler generative models that do not model variability. Moreover, in analyzing physiological signals from infants in the ICU, we discover both known signatures as well as novel physiomarkers.},

	abstract = {Large-scale sensor deployments and an increased use of privacy-preserving transformations have led to an increasing interest in mining uncertain time series data. Traditional distance measures such as Euclidean distance or dynamic time warping are not always effective for analyzing uncertain time series data. Recently, some measures have been proposed to account for uncertainty in time series data. However, we show in this paper that their applicability is limited. In specific, these approaches do not provide an intuitive way to compare two uncertain time series and do not easily accommodate multiple error functions. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that generalizes the notion of similarity between uncertain time series. Secondly, we propose DUST, a novel distance measure that accommodates uncertainty and degenerates to the Euclidean distance when the distance is large compared to the error. We provide an extensive experimental validation of our approach for the following applications: classification, top-k motif search, and top-k nearest-neighbor queries. © 2010 ACM.},

The populations of the single acceptor, double acceptor, and free type water molecules are found to be significantly high unlike that in pure water clusters. Free hydrogens of these type of water molecules primarily capture the unbound electron density in these clusters. It is found that the binding motifs of the free electron evolve with time and the vertical detachment energy of (H2O)6? and vertical ionization energy of Li(H2O)6 also change with time. Assignments of the observed peaks in vibrational power spectra are done, and we found direct correlations between the time-averaged population of water molecules in different hydrogen bonding states and the spectral features.

	abstract = {Granger causality (GC) and its extension have been used widely to infer causal relationships from multivariate time series generated from biological systems. GC is ideally suited for causal inference in bivariate vector autoregressive process (VAR). A zero magnitude of the upper or lower off-diagonal element(s) in a bivariate VAR is indicative of lack of causal relationship in that direction resulting in true acyclic structures. However, in experimental settings, statistical tests, such as F-test that rely on the ratio of the mean-squared forecast errors, are used to infer significant GC relationships. The present study investigates acyclic approximations within the context of bi-directional two-gene network motifs modeled as bivariate VAR. The fine interplay between the model parameters in the bivariate VAR, namely: (i) transcriptional noise variance, (ii) autoregulatory feedback, and (iii) transcriptional coupling strength that can give rise to discrepancies in the ratio of the mean-squared forecast errors is investigated. Subsequently, their impact on statistical power is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. More importantly, it is shown that one can arrive at acyclic approximations even for bi-directional networks for suitable choice of process parameters, significance level and sample size. While the results are discussed within the framework of transcriptional network, the analytical treatment provided is generic and likely to have significant impact across distinct paradigms. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.},

	abstract = {We study behavioral action sequences of players in a massive multiplayer online game. In their virtual life players use eight basic actions which allow them to interact with each other. These actions are communication, trade, establishing or breaking friendships and enmities, attack, and punishment. We measure the probabilities for these actions conditional on previous taken and received actions and find a dramatic increase of negative behavior immediately after receiving negative actions. Similarly, positive behavior is intensified by receiving positive actions. We observe a tendency towards anti-persistence in communication sequences. Classifying actions as positive (good) and negative (bad) allows us to define binary 'world lines' of lives of individuals. Positive and negative actions are persistent and occur in clusters, indicated by large scaling exponents α~0.87 of the mean square displacement of the world lines. For all eight action types we find strong signs for high levels of repetitiveness, especially for negative actions. We partition behavioral sequences into segments of length n (behavioral 'words' and 'motifs') and study their statistical properties. We find two approximate power laws in the word ranking distribution, one with an exponent of k~-1 for the ranks up to 100, and another with a lower exponent for higher ranks. The Shannon n-tuple redundancy yields large values and increases in terms of word length, further underscoring the non-trivial statistical properties of behavioral sequences. On the collective, societal level the timeseries of particular actions per day can be understood by a simple mean-reverting log-normal model. © 2012 Thurner et al.},

	abstract = {Infrared thermography is widely used to measure the thermal diffusivity of materials. A thermographic experiment usually consists in illuminating the front face of a sample by a light beam (point like, line, or other motifs) and detecting the thermal response of the sample on either its front or its rear face. The light beam intensity can be Dirac-like, modulated, pseudorandom, etc. The thermal behavior of the sample is observed using an infrared camera with a focal plane array of infrared detectors. The development of infrared video cameras with fast data acquisition (thousands of images=s) and high lateral resolution (tens of micrometers) provides powerful tools for fast materials testing. The drawback of these cameras is the huge amount of noisy data to be treated. To overcome such a difﬁculty, experimental conditions are usually chosen so that simple analytical solutions of the heat conduction problem exist. For instance, the diffusivity of homogeneous materials can be easily studied by the so-called slope method when illuminating a thin but large enough sample placed in a vacuum chamber by a point-like or a line-like intensity modulated laser beam (see, e.g., Mendioroz et al. 2009 and references within). Otherwise (i.e. heterogeneous materials, other lighting motifs), the estimation process (heat conduction model inversion) becomes a tricky task: computing time and memory resources required when using standard approaches, i.e., diffusivity estimation by minimization of a chosen residuals norm deﬁned over the whole spatial domain, are generally huge while results are very sensitive to noise when using point-by-point least squares estimation approaches (see Chapter 7). In such a sense, mathematical tools allowing signiﬁcant reduction of the data set dimension, as well as noise control and parsimonious estimations, could be an interesting alternative for extending characterization of materials based on Infrared thermography to situations with unknown analytical solutions. Proper orthogonal decomposition techniques are widely used for multivariate data reduction inmany areas of application. The reduction starts by choosing an appropriate orthogonal basis allowing identiﬁcation of some few dominant components (referred to as dominant directions, eigenfunctions, or modes). A low-dimensional approximate description of the whole set of data is thus obtained by projecting the initial high-dimensional set on the dominant eigenfunctions. The choice of the basis makes the main difference among methods. When dealing with regular signals, those arising out of spectral decomposition of the energy matrix (or covariance matrix) of the multivariate data give the best results. This means that it provides the lowest dimension for a given approximation precision or, alternatively, the best precision for a given dimension. Such a method has been developed about 100 years ago by Pearson (1901) as a tool for graphical data analysis and redeveloped several times since then in different areas of application (Hotteling 1933, Karhunen 1946, Loève 1955), that it has assumedmany names such as principal components analysis (PCA), Karhunen-Loève decomposition (KLD), singular value decomposition (SVD), etc. PCA=KLD=SVD is very commonly used today in image processing and signal processing problems for compression and noise reduction (Deprettere 1988). It is also widely used for signals classiﬁcation, data clustering, and information retrieval problems (Berry et al. 1995, Everitt and Dunn 2001, Everitt et al. 2001). Powerful model reduction techniques based on PCA=KLD=SVD have been also proposed for low-dimensional description of problems described by partial differential equations, mostly in the ﬁeld of turbulent ﬂows (Berkoz et al. 1993, Holmes et al. 1996). In thermal analysis, SVD-based methods have been developed for efﬁcient reduction of linear and nonlinear heat transfer problems (Ait-Yahia and Palomo del Barrio 1999, 2000; Palomo del Barrio 2000; Dauvergne and Palomo del Barriosources (Park and Jung 1999, 2001, Palomo del Barrio 2003a, b). For a fairly comprehensive introduction to PCA=KLD=SVD, we recommend the books by Jolliffe (1986) and Deprettere (1988). For more details on the mathematics and computation, good references are Golub and Van Loan (1996), Strang (1998), Berry (1992), and Jessup and Sorensen (1994). This chapter focuses on the use of KLD techniques in association with infrared thermog-raphy for reliable and parsimonious thermal characterization of materials. In Section 14.2, the KLD of inﬁnite-dimensional and ﬁnite-dimensional problems is deﬁned. Functions and signal considered are, respectively, space-time-dependent functions and multivariate time series. In the framework of thermal analysis, functions represent the thermal ﬁeld while multivariate time series are data taken from thermal ﬁeld sampling. The property of KLD to provide the closest r-dimensional approximation for an inﬁnite-dimensional problem or the closest rank-r approximation for a rank-n (n> r) matrix is used. A numerical example illustrates the application of KLD for this problem. In Section 14.4, measurement noise propagation through KLD is analyzed and two KLD-based ﬁlters are described. The application of KLD for data ﬁltering is highlighted using a numerical example. A KLDbased method for reliable estimation of the diffusivity of homogeneous materials is described and tested in Section 14.5, while Section 14.6 focuses on thermal characterization of heterogeneous materials.

However, the determinants of superfamily classification are unclear. We attack this problem by studying the influence of linear temporal correlations and multifractality using fractional Brownian motions and multifractal random walks. Numerical investigations unveil that the classification of a superfamily phenomenon is uniquely determined by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) scaling exponent α of the time series. Only four motif patterns are observed in the simulated data, which are delimited by three DFA scaling exponents α ≃ 0.25, α ≃ 0.35 and α ≃ 0.45.

	abstract = {One significant task in time series mining research area is motif discovery which is the first step needed to be done in finding interesting patterns in time series sequence. Recently, many motif discovery algorithms have been proposed in place of the untenable brute-force algorithm, to improve its time complexity. However, those motif discovery algorithms still need a predefined sliding window length that must be known a priori. In this paper, we present a novel motif discovery algorithm that requires no window length parameter. This sliding window length is sensitive in that a small difference in the value can lead to huge difference of motif results. The proposed algorithm automatically returns suitable motif lengths from all possible sliding window lengths; in other words, our algorithm efficiently reduces a large set of possibilities of the sliding window lengths down to a few truly-interesting variable-length motifs. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis aims at understanding the dynamics of stochastic or chaotic processes. In recent years, quite a few methods have been proposed to transform a single time series to a complex network so that the dynamics of the process can be understood by investigating the topological properties of the network. We study the topological properties of horizontal visibility graphs constructed from fractional Brownian motions with different Hurst indexes H ∈ (0,1). Special attention has been paid to the impact of the Hurst index on topological properties. It is found that the clustering coefficient C decreases when H increases. We also found that the mean length L of the shortest paths increases exponentially with H for fixed length N of the original time series. In addition, L increases linearly with respect to N when H is close to 1 and in a logarithmic form when H is close to 0. Although the occurrence of different motifs changes with H, the motif rank pattern remains unchanged for different H. Adopting the node-covering box-counting method, the horizontal visibility graphs are found to be fractals and the fractal dimension dB decreases with H. Furthermore, the Pearson coefficients of the networks are positive and the degree-degree correlations increase with degree, which indicate that the horizontal visibility graphs are assortative. With the increase of H, the Pearson coefficient decreases first and then increases, in which the turning point is around H = 0.6. The presence of both fractality and assortativity in the horizontal visibility graphs converted from fractional Brownian motions is different from many cases where fractal networks are usually disassortative. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {A key challenge in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease is matching patients to treatments that are most appropriate for them. Different cardiac assessment tools have been developed to address this goal. Recent research has focused on heart rate motifs, i.e., short-term heart rate sequences that are over- or under-represented in long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients experiencing cardiovascular outcomes, which provide novel and valuable information for risk stratification. However, this approach can leverage only a small number of motifs for prediction and results in difficult to interpret models. We address these limitations by identifying latent structure in the large numbers of motifs found in long-term ECG recordings. In particular, we explore the application of topic models to heart rate time series to identify functional sets of heart rate sequences and to concisely describe patients using task-independent features for various cardiovascular outcomes. We evaluate the approach on a large collection of real-world ECG data, and investigate the performance of topic mixture features for the prediction of cardiovascular mortality. The topics provided an interpretable representation of the recordings and maintained valuable information for clinical assessment when compared with motif frequencies, even after accounting for commonly used clinical risk scores.

Most available algorithms cannot utilize domain knowledge in any way which results in quadratic or at least super-linear time and space complexity. In this paper we define the Constrained Motif Discovery problem which enables utilization of domain knowledge into the motif discovery process. The paper then provides two algorithms called MCFull and MCInc for efficiently solving the constrained motif discovery problem. We also show that most unconstrained motif discovery problems be converted into constrained ones using a change-point detection algorithm. A novel change-point detection algorithm called the Robust Singular Spectrum Transform (RSST) is then introduced and compared to traditional Singular Spectrum Transform using synthetic and real-world data sets. The results show that RSST achieves higher specificity and is more adequate for finding constraints to convert unconstrained motif discovery problems to constrained ones that can be solved using MCFull and MCInc. We then compare the combination of RSST and MCFull or MCInc with two state-of-the-art motif discovery algorithms on a large set of synthetic time series. The results show that the proposed algorithms provided four to ten folds increase in speed compared the unconstrained motif discovery algorithms studied without any loss of accuracy. RSST+MCFull is then used in a real world human-robot interaction experiment to enable the robot to learn free hand gestures, actions, and their associations by watching humans and other robots interacting.},

Several algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem. However, these algorithms heavily use expensive random disk accesses or assume the data can fit into main memory. They only consider motifs at a single resolution and are not suited to interactivity. In this work, we tackle the motif discovery problem as an approximate Top-K frequent subsequence discovery problem. We fully exploit state of the art iSAX representation multiresolution capability to obtain motifs at different resolutions. This property yields interactivity, allowing the user to navigate along the Top-K motifs structure. This permits a deeper understanding of the time series database. Further, we apply the Top-K space saving algorithm to our frequent subsequences approach. A scalable algorithm is obtained that is suitable for data stream like applications where small memory devices such as sensors are used. Our approach is scalable and disk-efficient since it only needs one single pass over the time series database. We provide empirical evidence of the validity of the algorithm in datasets from different areas that aim to represent practical applications. Copyright © by SIAM.},

Here we investigate the complexity of temporal gene expression patterns using the concept of Permutation Entropy (PE) first introduced in dynamical systems theory. The analysis of gene expression data has so far focused primarily on the identification of differentially expressed genes, or on the elucidation of pathway and regulatory relationships. We aim to study gene expression time series data from the viewpoint of complexity.Results: Applying the PE complexity metric to abiotic stress response time series data in Arabidopsis thaliana, genes involved in stress response and signaling were found to be associated with the highest complexity not only under stress, but surprisingly, also under reference, non-stress conditions. Genes with house-keeping functions exhibited lower PE complexity. Compared to reference conditions, the PE of temporal gene expression patterns generally increased upon stress exposure. High-complexity genes were found to have longer upstream intergenic regions and more cis-regulatory motifs in their promoter regions indicative of a more complex regulatory apparatus needed to orchestrate their expression, and to be associated with higher correlation network connectivity degree. Arabidopsis genes also present in other plant species were observed to exhibit decreased PE complexity compared to Arabidopsis specific genes.Conclusions: We show that Permutation Entropy is a simple yet robust and powerful approach to identify temporal gene expression profiles of varying complexity that is equally applicable to other types of molecular profile data. © 2010 Sun et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

By means of this prototype optimization method, we search for prototypes that yield a good class separation. Furthermore, the optimization is able to cope with approximately labelled training data, since optimal prototypes can be found in subseries of class templates.

	abstract = {Recently, a framework for analyzing time series by constructing an associated complex network has attracted significant research interest. One of the advantages of the complex network method for studying time series is that complex network theory provides a tool to describe either important nodes, or structures that exist in the networks, at different topological scale. This can then provide distinct information for time series of different dynamical systems. In this paper, we systematically investigate the recurrence-based phase space network of order k that has previously been used to specify different types of dynamics in terms of the motif ranking from a different perspective. Globally, we find that the network size scales with different scale exponents and the degree distribution follows a quasi-symmetric bell shape around the value of 2k with different values of degree variance from periodic to chaotic Rössler systems. Local network properties such as the vertex degree, the clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality are found to be sensitive to the local stability of the orbits and hence contain complementary information. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {We construct complex networks from symbolic time series of particle properties within a dense quasistatically deforming granular assembly subjected to biaxial compression. The structure of the resulting networks embodies the evolving structural rearrangements in the granular material, in both contact forces and contact topologies. These rearrangements are usefully summarized through standard network statistics as well as building block motifs and community structures. Dense granular media respond to applied compression and shear by a process of self-organization to form two cooperatively evolving structures comprising the major load-bearing columnlike force chains, and the lateral trusslike three-cycle triangle topologies. We construct networks summarizing their individual evolution based on relationships between symbolic time series indicating a particle's chronological force chain and three-cycle membership histories. We test which particle membership histories are similar with respect to each other through the information theory-based measure of Hamming distance. The complex networks summarize the essential structural rearrangements, while the community structures within the networks partition the material into distinct zones of deformation, including interlacing subregions of failure inside the shear band. The taxonomy of granular rheology at the mesoscopic scale distills the inelastic structural rearrangements throughout loading history down to its core elements, and should lay bare an objective and physics-based formalism for thermodynamic internal variables and associated evolution laws. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {This article presents SwiftMotif, a novel technique for on-line motif detection in time series. With this technique, frequently occurring temporal patterns or anomalies can be discovered, for instance. The motif detection is based on a fusion of methods from two worlds: probabilistic modeling and similarity measurement techniques are combined with extremely fast polynomial least-squares approximation techniques. A time series is segmented with a data stream segmentation method, the segments are modeled by means of normal distributions with time-dependent means and constant variances, and these models are compared using a divergence measure for probability densities. Then, using suitable clustering algorithms based on these similarity measures, motifs may be defined. The fast time series segmentation and modeling techniques then allow for an on-line detection of previously defined motifs in new time series with very low run-times. SwiftMotif is suitable for real-time applications, accounts for the uncertainty associated with the occurrence of certain motifs, e.g., due to noise, and considers local variability (i.e., uniform scaling) in the time domain. This article focuses on the mathematical foundations and the demonstration of properties of SwiftMotif-in particular accuracy and run-time-using some artificial and real benchmark time series. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Recurrence networks are a powerful nonlinear tool for time series analysis of complex dynamical systems. While there are already many successful applications ranging from medicine to paleoclimatology, a solid theoretical foundation of the method has still been missing so far. Here, we interpret an -recurrence network as a discrete subnetwork of a "continuous" graph with uncountably many vertices and edges corresponding to the system's attractor. This step allows us to show that various statistical measures commonly used in complex network analysis can be seen as discrete estimators of newly defined continuous measures of certain complex geometric properties of the attractor on the scale given by. In particular, we introduce local measures such as the -clustering coefficient, mesoscopic measures such as -motif density, path-based measures such as -betweennesses, and global measures such as -efficiency. This new analytical basis for the so far heuristically motivated network measures also provides an objective criterion for the choice of via a percolation threshold, and it shows that estimation can be improved by so-called node splitting invariant versions of the measures. We finally illustrate the framework for a number of archetypical chaotic attractors such as those of the Bernoulli and logistic maps, periodic and two-dimensional quasiperiodic motions, and for hyperballs and hypercubes by deriving analytical expressions for the novel measures and comparing them with data from numerical experiments. More generally, the theoretical framework put forward in this work describes random geometric graphs and other networks with spatial constraints, which appear frequently in disciplines ranging from biology to climate science. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Background: It is often desirable to separate effects of different regulators on gene expression, or to identify effects of the same regulator across several systems. Here, we focus on the rat brain following stroke or seizures, and demonstrate how the two tasks can be approached simultaneously.Results: We applied SVD to time-series gene expression datasets from the rat experimental models of stroke and seizures. We demonstrate conservation of two eigensystems, reflecting inflammation and/or apoptosis (eigensystem 2) and neuronal synaptic activity (eigensystem 3), between the stroke and seizures. We analyzed cis-regulation of gene expression in the subspaces of the conserved eigensystems. Bayesian networks analysis was performed separately for either experimental model, with cross-system validation of the highest-ranking features. In this way, we correctly re-discovered the role of AP1 in the regulation of apoptosis, and the involvement of Creb and Egr in the regulation of synaptic activity-related genes.We identified a novel antagonistic effect of the motif recognized by the nuclear matrix attachment region-binding protein Satb1 on AP1-driven transcriptional activation, suggesting a link between chromatin loop structure and gene activation by AP1. The effects of motifs binding Satb1 and Creb on gene expression in brain conform to the assumption of the linear response model of gene regulation. Our data also suggest that numerous enhancers of neuronal-specific genes are important for their responsiveness to the synaptic activity.Conclusion: Eigensystems conserved between stroke and seizures separate effects of inflammation/apoptosis and neuronal synaptic activity, exerted by different transcription factors, on gene expression in rat brain. © 2010 Dabrowski et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Network motifs are small modules that show interesting functional and dynamic properties, and are believed to be the building blocks of complex cellular processes. However, the mechanistic details of such modules are often unknown: there is uncertainty about the motif architecture as well as the functional form and parameter values when converted to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This translates into a number of candidate models being compatible with the system under study. A variety of statistical methods exist for ranking models including maximum likelihood-based and Bayesian methods. Our objective is to show how such methods can be applied in a typical systems biology setting.Results: We focus on four commonly occurring network motif structures and show that it is possible to differentiate between them using simulated data and any of the model comparison methods tested. We expand one of the motifs, the feed forward (FF) motif, for several possible parameterizations and apply model selection on simulated data. We then use experimental data on three biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli to formally assess how current knowledge matches the time series available. Our analysis confirms two of them as FF motifs. Only an expanded set of FF motif parameterisations using time delays is able to fit the third pathway, indicating that the true mechanism might be more complex in this case.Conclusions: Maximum likelihood as well as Bayesian model comparison methods are suitable for selecting a plausible motif model among a set of candidate models. Our work shows that it is practical to apply model comparison to test ideas about underlying mechanisms of biological pathways in a formal and quantitative way. © 2010 Domedel-Puig et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Time series are ubiquitous in all domains of human endeavor. They are generated, stored, and manipulated during any kind of activity. The goal of this chapter is to introduce a novel approach to mine multidimensional time-series data for causal relationships. The main feature of the proposed system is supporting discovery of causal relations based on automatically discovered recurring patterns in the input time series. This is achieved by integrating a variety of data mining techniques. The main insight of the proposed system is that causal relations can be found more easily and robustly by analyzing meaningful events in the time series rather than by analyzing the time series numerical values directly. The RSST (Robust Singular Spectrum Transform) algorithm is used to find interesting points in every time series that is further analyzed by a constrained motif discovery algorithm (if needed) to learn basic events of the time series. The Granger-causality test is extended and applied to the multidimensional time-series describing the occurrences of these basic events rather than to the raw time-series data. The combined algorithm is evaluated using both synthetic and real world data. The real world application is to mine records of activities during a human-robot interaction experiment in which a human subject is guiding a robot to navigate using free hand gesture. The results show that the combined system can provide causality graphs representing the underlying relations between the human's actions and robot behavior that cannot be recovered using standard causal graph learning procedures. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

As with their discrete analogues in computational biology, this similarity hints at structure which has been conserved for some reason and may therefore be of interest. Since the formalism of time series motifs in 2002, dozens of researchers have used them for diverse applications in many different domains. Because the obvious algorithm for computing motifs is quadratic in the number of items, more than a dozen approximate algorithms to discover motifs have been proposed in the literature. In this work, for the first time, we show a tractable exact algorithm to find time series motifs. As we shall show through extensive experiments, our algorithm is up to three orders of magnitude faster than brute-force search in large datasets. We further show that our algorithm is fast enough to be used as a subroutine in higher level data mining algorithms for anytime classification, near-duplicate detection and summarization, and we consider detailed case studies in domains as diverse as electroencephalograph interpretation and entomological telemetry data mining.},

We demonstrate that the qualitative influences defined by QPNs exhibit a natural mapping to naturally-occurring patterns of connections, termed network motifs, embedded in Gene Regulatory Networks and present a model that maps QPN constructs to such motifs. The contribution of this paper is that of discovering motifs by mapping their time-series experimental data to QPN influences and using the discovered motifs to aid the process of reconstructing the corresponding gene regulatory network via Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). The general aim is to compile a model that uses qualitative equivalents of Dynamic Bayesian Networks to explore gene expression networks and their regulatory mechanisms.

	abstract = {Feedback circuits are crucial dynamic motifs which occur in many biomolecular regulatory networks. They play a pivotal role in the regulation and control of many important cellular processes such as gene transcription, signal transduction, and metabolism. In this study, we develop a novel computationally efficient method to identify feedback loops embedded in intracellular networks, which uses only time-series experimental data and requires no knowledge of the network structure. In the proposed approach, a non-parametric system identification technique, as well as a spectral factor analysis, is applied to derive a graphical criterion based on non-causal components of the system's impulse response. The appearance of non-causal components in the impulse response sequences arising from stochastic output perturbations is shown to imply the presence of underlying feedback connections within a linear network. In order to extend the approach to nonlinear networks, we linearize the intracellular networks about an equilibrium point, and then choose the magnitude of the output perturbations sufficiently small so that the resulting time-series responses remain close to the chosen equilibrium point. In this way, the impulse response sequences of the linearized system can be used to determine the presence or absence of feedback loops in the corresponding nonlinear network. The proposed method utilizes the time profile data from intracellular perturbation experiments and only requires the perturbability of output nodes. Most importantly, the method does not require any a priori knowledge of the system structure. For these reasons, the proposed approach is very well suited to identifying feedback loops in large-scale biomolecular networks. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via two examples: a synthetic network model with a negative feedback loop and a nonlinear caspase function model of apoptosis with a positive feedback loop. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

The search of recurrent patterns in temporal sequences, so called motifs that are deemed to be discovered in both the experiments and the real observations and 2.) the matching of motifs to linguistic terms which are possibly available as domain knowledge. Therefore we describe an effective time series representation that enormously speeds up the search for these motifs. We present some approaches to adjust the designed experiments with the help of the discovered motifs. © Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag.},

In this paper, an effective nonparametric identification method, Non-causal Impulse Response Component Method (NIRCM) is developed to identify feedback loops embedded in biological neural networks, which uses only time-series experimental data. The NIRCM, based on correlation identification and spectral factor analysis, provides a non-causal component criterion for the identification of feedback loops. Significant non-causal components of the impulse response sequences observed in the negative time axis imply an existence of feedback loop. The proposed identification method was applied to several 2-node SRM (Spike Response Model) networks.

	abstract = {An efficient two-step Markov blanket method for modeling and inferring complex regulatory networks from large-scale microarray data sets is presented. The inferred gene regulatory network (GRN) is based on the time series gene expression data capturing the underlying gene interactions. For constructing a highly accurate GRN, the proposed method performs: 1) discovery of a gene's Markov Blanket (MB), 2) formulation of a flexible measure to determine the network's quality, 3) efficient searching with the aid of a guided genetic algorithm, and 4) pruning to obtain a minimal set of correct interactions. Investigations are carried out using both synthetic as well as yeast cell cycle gene expression data sets. The realistic synthetic data sets validate the robustness of the method by varying topology, sample size, time delay, noise, vertex in-degree, and the presence of hidden nodes. It is shown that the proposed approach has excellent inferential capabilities and high accuracy even in the presence of noise. The gene network inferred from yeast cell cycle data is investigated for its biological relevance using well-known interactions, sequence analysis, motif patterns, and GO data. Further, novel interactions are predicted for the unknown genes of the network and their influence on other genes is also discussed. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Microarray technology is a powerful and widely accepted experimental technique in molecular biology that allows studying genome wide transcriptional responses. However, experimental data usually contain potential sources of uncertainty and thus many experiments are now designed with repeated measurements to better assess such inherent variability. Many computational methods have been proposed to account for the variability in replicates. As yet, there is no model to output expression profiles accounting for replicate information so that a variety of computational models that take the expression profiles as the input data can explore this information without any modification.Results: We propose a methodology which integrates replicate variability into expression profiles, to generate so-called 'true' expression profiles. The study addresses two issues: (i) develop a statistical model that can estimate 'true' expression profiles which are more robust than the average profile, and (ii) extend our previous micro-clustering which was designed specifically for clustering time-series expression data. The model utilizes a previously proposed error model and the concept of 'relative difference'. The clustering effectiveness is demonstrated through synthetic data where several methods are compared. We subsequently analyze in vivo rat data to elucidate circadian transcriptional dynamics as well as liver-specific corticosteroid induced changes in gene expression.Conclusions: We have proposed a model which integrates the error information from repeated measurements into the expression profiles. Through numerous synthetic and real time-series data, we demonstrated the ability of the approach to improve the clustering performance and assist in the identification and selection of informative expression motifs. © 2010 Nguyen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Transcriptional reprogramming forms a major part of a plant's response to pathogen infection. Many individual components and pathways operating during plant defense have been identified, but our knowledge of how these different components interact is still rudimentary. We generated a high-resolution time series of gene expression profiles from a single Arabidopsis thaliana leaf during infection by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Approximately one-third of the Arabidopsis genome is differentially expressed during the first 48 h after infection, with the majority of changes in gene expression occurring before significant lesion development. We used computational tools to obtain a detailed chronology of the defense response against B. cinerea, highlighting the times at which signaling and metabolic processes change, and identify transcription factor families operating at different times after infection. Motif enrichment and network inference predicted regulatory interactions, and testing of one such prediction identified a role for TGA3 in defense against necrotrophic pathogens. These data provide an unprecedented level of detail about transcriptional changes during a defense response and are suited to systems biology analyses to generate predictive models of the gene regulatory networks mediating the Arabidopsis response to B. cinerea. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Traditional time series databases are populated using segments extracted by a sliding window.

Salient segmentation is a probabilistic segmentation technique for populating medical time series databases. Segments with the lowest probabilities are considered salient and are inserted into the index. The resulting index has little redundancy and is composed of aligned segments. This approach reduces index sizes by more than 98% over conventional sliding window techniques. Furthermore, salient segmentation can reduce redundancy in motif discovery algorithms by more than 85%, yielding a more succinct representation of a time series signal. © 2011 IEEE.},

As a large time series can contain hundreds of motifs, there is a need to support interactive analysis and exploration. In addition, for certain applications, such as data center resource management, service managers want to be able to predict the next day's power consumption from the previous months' data. For this purpose, we introduce four novel visual analytics methods: (i) motif layout - using colored rectangles for visualizing the occurrences and hierarchical relationships of motifs; (ii) motif distortion - enlarging or shrinking motifs for visualizing them more clearly; (iii) motif merging - combining a number of identical adjacent motif instances to simplify the display; and (iv) pattern preserving prediction - using a pattern-preserving smoothing and prediction algorithm to provide a reliable prediction for seasonal data. We have applied these methods to three real-world datasets: data center chilling utilization, oil well production, and system resource utilization. The results enable service managers to interactively examine motifs and gain new insights into the recurring patterns to analyze system operations. Using the above methods, we have also predicted both power consumption and server utilization in data centers with an accuracy of 70-80%. © The Author(s) 2011.},

By means of phase plane analysis, that involves analytically obtaining the curves guiding the motion of the phase point, we show how the neuron dynamics can be explained in terms of switches between the noninteracting and interacting map. The developed approach provides an insight into the observed time series, highlighting the mechanisms behind the regimes of collective dynamics, including those concerning the emergent phenomena of partial and common oscillation death, hyperpolarization of membrane potential and the prolonged quiescence. The interdependence between the chaotic neuron series takes the form of intermittent synchronization, where the entrainment of membrane potential variables occurs within the sequences of finite duration. The contribution from the overlap of certain block sequences embedding emergent phenomena gives rise to the sudden increase of the parameter characterizing synchronization. We find its onset to follow a power law, that holds with respect to the coupling strength and the stimulation current. It is established how different types of synaptic threshold behavior, controlled by the gain parameter, influence the values of the scaling exponents. © 2010 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We interpreted their expression time differences by statistical inferences based on prior biological knowledge, and identified the following significant changes: (i) between 12 and 24 h, stress response genes were up-regulated by larger fold changes and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing genes were down-regulated more dramatically; (ii) mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes were not up-regulated between 12 and 60 h as wild type were; (iii) electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation and TCA genes were down-regulated early; (iv) the up-regulation of TCA and electron transport was accompanied by deep down-regulation of rRNA processing over time; and (v) rRNA processing genes were more volatile over time, and three associated cis-regulatory elements [rRNA processing element (rRPE), polymerase A and C (PAC) and glucose response element (GRE)] were identified. Deletion of AZF1, which encodes the transcriptional factor that binds to the GRE element, reversed the lifespan extension of sch9Δ. The significant alterations in these time-dependent expression profiles imply that the lack of SCH9 turns on the longevity programme that extends the lifespan through changes in metabolic pathways and protection mechanisms, particularly, the regulation of aerobic respiration and rRNA processing. © The Author(s) 2009.

	abstract = {The Symbolic Aggregate approXimation algorithm (SAX) is a very popular symbolic mapping technique for time series data, and it is widely employed in pattern identification, sequence classification, abnormality detection and other data mining research. Although SAX is a general approach which is adaptable to most data, it utilises a fixed-size sliding window in order to generate motifs (temporal shapes). When certain target phenomena (activities of interest) are manifested over differing time scales, SAX-motifs are unable to correctly account for all such targets. This paper proposes a new method named the variance-wise segmentation method which can adaptively change the size of the sliding window in a generalised SAX approach. By generating motifs with differing durations, patterns can be found for activities with similar shape but occurring over a significant altered time base. This method is tested on both artificially modified ECG data, as well as, variable tactile vibration data, with improved results compared to the original SAX formulation. © 2012, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Transcription initiation is a key component in the regulation of gene expression. mRNA 5′ full-length sequencing techniques have enhanced our understanding of mammalian transcription start sites (TSSs), revealing different initiation patterns on a genomic scale. Results: To identify TSSs in Drosophila melanogaster, we applieda hierarchical clustering strategy on available 5' expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and identified a high quality set of 5,665 TSSs for approximately 4,000 genes. We distinguished two initiation patterns: 'peaked' TSSs, and 'broad' TSS cluster groups. Peaked promoters were found to contain location-specific sequence elements; conversely, broad promoters were associated with non-location-specific elements. In alignments across other Drosophila genomes, conservation levels of sequence elements exceeded 90% within the melanogaster subgroup, but dropped considerably for distal species. Elements in broad promoters had lower levels of conservation than those in peaked promoters. When characterizing the distributions of ESTs, 64% of TSSs showed distinct associations to one out of eight different spatiotemporal conditions. Available whole-genome tiling array time series data revealed different temporal patterns of embryonic activity across the majority of genes with distinct alternative promoters. Many genes with maternally inherited transcripts were found to have alternative promoters utilized later in development. Core promoters of maternally inherited transcripts showed differences in motif composition compared to zygotically active promoters. Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive map of Drosophila TSSs and the conditions under which they are utilized. Distinct differences in motif associations with initiation pattern and spatiotemporal utilization illustrate the complex regulatory code of transcription initiation. © 2009 Rach et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Outliers in time series can lead to unreliable modeling and poor forecasts. Therefore, the identification of future outlier occurrence is an essential task in time series analysis to reduce the average forecasting error. The main goal of this work is to predict the occurrence of outliers in time series, based on the discovery of motifs. In this sense, motifs will be those pattern sequences preceding certain data marked as anomalous by the proposed metaheuristic in a training set. Once the motifs are discovered, if data to be predicted are preceded by any of them, such data are identified as outliers, and treated separately from the rest of regular data. The forecasting of outlier occurrence has been added as an additional step in an existing time series forecasting algorithm (PSF), which was based on pattern sequence similarities. Robust statistical methods have been used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach regarding the forecasting of both occurrence of outliers and their corresponding values. Finally, the methodology has been tested on six electricity-related time series, in which most of the outliers were properly found and forecasted. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Complex networks have been used successfully in scientific disciplines ranging from sociology to microbiology to describe systems of interacting units. Until recently, studies of complex networks have mainly focused on their network topology. However, in many real world applications, the edges and vertices have associated attributes that are frequently represented as vertex or edge weights. Furthermore, these weights are often not static, instead changing with time and forming a time series. Hence, to fully understand the dynamics of the complex network, we have to consider both network topology and related time series data. In this work, we propose a motif mining approach to identify trend motifs for such purposes. Simply stated, a trend motif describes a recurring subgraph where each of its vertices or edges displays similar dynamics over a user-defined period. Given this, each trend motif occurrence can help reveal significant events in a complex system; frequent trend motifs may aid in uncovering dynamic rules of change for the system, and the distribution of trend motifs may characterize the global dynamics of the system. Here, we have developed efficient mining algorithms to extract trend motifs. Our experimental validation using three disparate empirical datasets, ranging from the stock market, world trade, to a protein interaction network, has demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. © 2007 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background. SoxR and SoxS constitute an intracellular signal response system that rapidly detects changes in superoxide levels and modulates gene expression in E. coli. A time series microarray design was used to identify co-regulated SoxRS-dependent and independent genes modulated by superoxide minutes after exposure to stress. Methodology/principal findings. soxS mRNA levels surged to near maximal levels within the first few minutes of exposure to paraquat, a superoxide-producing compound, followed by a rise in mRNA levels of known SoxS-regulated genes. Based on a new method for determining the biological significance of clustering results, a total of 138 genic regions, including several transcription factors and putative sRNAs were identified as being regulated through the SoxRS signaling pathway within 10 minutes of paraquat treatment. A statistically significant two-block SoxS motif was identified through analysis of the SoxS-regulated genes. The SoxRS-independent response included members of the OxyR, CysB, IscR, BirA and Fur regulons. Finally, the relative sensitivity to superoxide was measured in 94 strains carrying deletions in individual, superoxide-regulated genes. Conclusions/significance. By integrating our microarray time series results with other microarray data, E coli databases and the primary literature, we propose a model of the primary transcriptional response containing 226 protein-coding and sRNA sequences. From the SoxS dependent network the first statistically significaut SoxS-related motif was identified. © 2007 Blanchard et al.},

	abstract = {Renal recipients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) should be treated with prolonged lamivudine. However, lamivudine resistance usually results after YMDD mutation within the HBV polymerase gene. Thereupon, the aim of this study was to investigate the genotypic resistance to lamivudine among renal transplant recipients to identify its effect on the clinical course of HBV in these patients. Between March 1997 and September 2003, eight of 17 renal transplant patients with hepatitis B virus were enrolled into this study and treated with 100 mg of lamivudine once each day. We amplified a selected region of the polymerase gene of HBV in order to confirm mutations in the YMDD motif. Mutations of YMDD region were observed in five of eight patients (62.5%). Out of five patients positive for HBV DNA, three (60%) showed genotypic resistance (YMDD mutation) with a normal ALT level. Two patients converted to HBV DNA negative. But, they were not associated with HBeAg seroconversion. Out of three patients who were pretransplant HBV DNA negative, genotypic resistance was observed in two patients (67%) revealing both positivity of HBe antibody and negativity of HBV DNA. In conclusion, although a normal ALT level and HBV DNA negative are maintained, the mutation of the YMDD locus may develop. Accordingly, we suggest that if the YMDD mutation is not involved in the progression of hepatitis B, lamivudine therapy should be continued despite genotypic resistance. © 2005 by Elsevier Inc.

We introduce a new algorithm that allows discovery of time series motifs with invariance to uniform scaling, and show that it produces objectively superior results in several important domains. Apart from being more general than all other motifdiscovery algorithms, a further contribution of our work isthat it is simpler than previous approaches, in particular we have drastically reduced the number of parameters that need to be specified. © 2007 ACM.},

	abstract = {The ability of mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) viruses to induce thymomas is determined, in part, by transcriptional enhancers in the U3 region of their long terminal repeats (LTRs). To elucidate sequence motifs important for enhancer function in vivo, we injected newborn mice with MCF 1dr (supF), a weakly pathogenic, molecularly tagged (supF) MCF virus containing only one copy of a sequence that is present as two copies (known as the directly repeated [DR] sequence) in the U3 region of MCF 247 and analyzed LTRs from supF-tagged proviruses in two resulting thymomas. Tagged proviruses integrated upstream and in the reverse transcriptional orientation relative to c-myc provided the focus of our studies. These proviruses are thought to contribute to thymoma induction by enhancer-mediated deregulation of c-myc expression. The U3 region in a tagged LTR in one thymoma was cloned and sequenced. Relative to MCF 1dr (supF), the cloned U3 region contained an insertion of 140 bp derived predominantly from the DR sequence of the injected virus. The inserted sequence contains predicted binding sites for transcription factors known to regulate the U3 regions of various murine leukemia viruses. Similar constellations of binding sites were duplicated in two proviral LTRs integrated upstream from c-myc in a second thymoma. We replaced the U3 sequences in an infectious molecular clone of MCF 247 with the cloned proviral U3 sequences from the first thymoma and generated an infectious chimeric virus, MCF ProEn. When injected into neonatal AKR mice, MCF ProEn was more pathogenic than the parental virus, MCF 1dr (supF), as evidenced by the more rapid onset and higher incidence of thymomas. Molecular analyses of the resultant thymomas indicated that the U3 region of MCF ProEn was genetically stable. These data suggest that the arrangement and/or redundancy of transcription factor binding sites generated by specific U3 sequence duplications are important to the biological events mediated hv MCF nroviruses integrated near c-mvc that contribute to transformation.},

	abstract = {Time series data is perhaps the most frequently encountered type of data examined by the data mining community. Clustering is perhaps the most frequently used data mining algorithm, being useful in it's own right as an exploratory technique, and also as a subroutine in more complex data mining algorithms such as rule discovery, indexing, summarization, anomaly detection, and classification. Given these two facts, it is hardly surprising that time series clustering has attracted much attention. The data to be clustered can be in one of two formats: many individual time series, or a single time series, from which individual time series are extracted with a sliding window. Given the recent explosion of interest in streaming data and online algorithms, the latter case has received much attention.In this work we make a surprising claim. Clustering of streaming time series is completely meaningless. More concretely, clusters extracted from streaming time series are forced to obey a certain constraint that is pathologically unlikely to be satisfied by any dataset, and because of this, the clusters extracted by any clustering algorithm are essentially random. While this constraint can be intuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and is simple to prove, it has never appeared in the literature.We can justify calling our claim surprising, since it invalidates the contribution of dozens of previously published papers. We will justify our claim with a theorem, illustrative examples, and a comprehensive set of experiments on reimplementations of previous work. Although the primary contribution of our work is to draw attention to the fact that an apparent solution to an important problem is incorrect and should no longer be used, we also introduce a novel method which, based on the concept of time series motifs, is able to meaningfully cluster some streaming time series datasets.

	abstract = {Is the dynamics in solution of flexible molecules Brownian and chaotic? And, could it be related to the elastomeric properties of macromolecules? In this framework molecular dynamics simulations and nonlinear theory analysis was used to examine the complexity of polypeptide motions in aqueous solutions. Global indicators of classical chaos and self-organised criticality are investigated and a model for elasticity of rubber proteins is proposed. The glycine-rich polypeptide Ac-Phe-Gly-Gly-Met-Gly-Gly-Gly-Asn-Ala-Gly-NMe, the repeat motif of the rubber protein Abductin, has been modelled in aqueous solution by nearly 30 ns of parallel molecular dynamics simulations and motions carefully analysed using nonlinear theory of complex systems. The most important conformational lengths describing the peptide size as end-to-end distance, gyration radius and the longest interatomic distance have been considered. Moreover, the configurational 3N-dimensional vector R, whose components are the Cartesian coordinates of peptide atoms, was considered as the global motion descriptor at the molecular scale. The system complexity was analysed in terms of time correlation functions, fast Fourier transforms, attractor dimension, Hurst and Lyapunov critical exponents. The global dynamics of R is Brownian with typical autocorrelation function and Fourier spectrum and Hurst exponent H = 1/2 was estimated. In contrast, the conformational lengths undergo anomalous diffusion with antipersistent fractional Brownian motion (H = 1/3) according to the Self-Organised Criticality - SOC - theory. The delay coordinate embedding shows the existence of a low dimensional chaotic attractor with five positive Lyapunov exponents typical of dissipative and chaotic systems. In the framework of the chaotic hypothesis, which assumes that the properties of statistical mechanics can be predicted by treating the systems as chaotic, and the Gaspard's microscopic motion observations, the Brownian dynamics of the peptide appear to be an emergent behaviour due to the chaos of an unstable state. The SOC regime of the polypeptide defines the metastable chaotic region of poor-solvent, observed for macromolecules between ideal θ solvation and phase separation, in agreement to the soft solution and protein rubber state. The proposed soft solution model can be crucial in the expression of the entropic elastic force exhibited by rubber proteins as Elastin and Abductin. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Ligand-dependent gene transcription mediated by the nuclear receptors involves the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which leads to interaction with the basal transcription machinery, and ultimately with RNA polymerase II. Although most of these coactivators are ubiquitously expressed, a tissue-selective coactivator, PGC-1, has recently been characterized. Because PGC-1 and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) possess an overlapping tissue distribution, we investigated whether PGC-1 is a coactivator for the retinoid X receptors. In a transient transfection assay, PGC-1 augments ligand-stimulated RXR transcription. Furthermore, PGC-1 efficiently enhances the RXR element-driven reporter gene transcription by all three RXR isoforms. An immunoprecipitation assay reveals that PGC-1 and RXRα interact in vivo. In addition, a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay showed that this interaction requires the presence of the LXXLL motif of PGC-1. We demonstrate further, in a mammalian two-hybrid assay, that this physical interaction also requires the presence of the AF-2 region of RXR to interact with the LXXLL motif of PGC-1, which is consistent with our proteinprotein interaction results. A time-resolved fluorescence assay shows that a peptide within the NR box of PGC-1 is efficiently recruited by a ligand-bound RXRα in vitro. Finally, PGC-1 and TIF2 synergistically enhance ligand-activated RXRa transcriptional activity. Taken together, these results indicate that PGC-1 is a bona fide coactivator for RXRα.},

We have already proposed a motif extraction method called Chaotic Motif Sampler (CMS) by using chaotic dynamics. Exploring a searching space with avoiding undesirable local minima, the CMS discovers the motifs very effectively. During a searching process, chaotic neurons generate very complicated spike time-series. In the present paper, we analyzed the complexity of the spike time-series observed from each chaotic neuron by using a statistical measure, such as a coefficient of variation and a local variation of interspike intervals, which are frequently used in the field of neuroscience. As a result, if a motif is embedded in a sequence, corresponding spike time-series show characteristic behavior. If we use these characteristics, multiple motifs can be identified. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Background: Elucidating the dynamic behaviour of genetic regulatory networks is one of the most significant challenges in systems biology. However, conventional quantitative predictions have been limited to small networks because publicly available transcriptome data has not been extensively applied to dynamic simulation. Results: We present a microarray data-based semi-kinetic (MASK) method which facilitates the prediction of regulatory dynamics of genetic networks composed of recurrently appearing network motifs with reasonable accuracy. The MASK method allows the determination of model parameters representing the contribution of regulators to transcription rate from time-series microarray data. Using a virtual regulatory network and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal protein gene module, we confirmed that a MASK model can predict expression profiles for various conditions as accurately as a conventional kinetic model. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the MASK method for the construction of dynamic simulation models of genetic networks from time-series microarray data, initial mRNA copy number and first-order degradation constants of mRNA. The quantitative accuracy of the MASK models has been confirmed, and the results indicated that this method enables the prediction of quantitative dynamics in genetic networks composed of commonly used network motifs, which cover considerable fraction of the whole network. © 2005 Yugi et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The Aerospace Corporation is responsible for providing engineering assessments critical to the go/no-go decision for every Department of Defense space vehicle. These assessments are made by constantly monitoring streaming telemetry data in the hours before launch. We will introduce VizTree, a novel time-series visualization tool to aid the Aerospace analysts who must make these engineering assessments. VizTree was developed at the University of California, Riverside and is unique in that the same tool is used for mining archival data and monitoring incoming live telemetry. The use of a single tool for both aspects of the task allows a natural and intuitive transfer of mined knowledge to the monitoring task. Our visualization approach works by transforming the time series into a symbolic representation, and encoding the data in a modified suffix tree in which the frequency and other properties of patterns are mapped onto colors and other visual properties. We demonstrate the utility of our system by comparing it with state-of-the-art batch algorithms on several real and synthetic datasets.},

We propose a novel approach based on multivariate adaptive splines to modelling regulatory roles of motifs in gene expression time series data. By applying the proposed approach on two meiotic datasets, we identified well-documented motifs as well as some novel putative motifs that are involved in the transcriptome reprogramming. In addition to identifying single regulatory motifs, we also modelled and unravelled motifs that manifest their effects through coupling with others in regulatory networks. Our findings reveal the potential of multivariate adaptive splines in deciphering complex and important transcriptional regulatory networks in eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {Background: Thermal injury is among the most severe forms of trauma and its effects are both local and systemic. Response to thermal injury includes cellular protection mechanisms, inflammation, hypermetabolism, prolonged catabolism, organ dysfunction and immuno-suppression. It has been hypothesized that gene expression patterns in the liver will change with severe burns, thus reflecting the role the liver plays in the response to burn injury. Characterizing the molecular fingerprint (i.e., expression profile) of the inflammatory response resulting from burns may help elucidate the activated mechanisms and suggest new therapeutic intervention. In this paper we propose a novel integrated framework for analyzing time-series transcriptional data, with emphasis on the burn-induced response within the context of the rat animal model. Our analysis robustly identifies critical expression motifs, indicative of the dynamic evolution of the inflammatory response and we further propose a putative reconstruction of the associated transcription factor activities. Results: Implementation of our algorithm on data obtained from an animal (rat) burn injury study identified 281 genes corresponding to 4 unique profiles. Enrichment evaluation upon both gene ontologies and transcription factors, verifies the inflammation-specific character of the selections and the rationalization of the burn-induced inflammatory response. Conducting the transcription network reconstruction and analysis, we have identified transcription factors, including AHR, Octamer Binding Proteins, Kruppel-like Factors, and cell cycle regulators as being highly important to an organism's response to burn response. These transcription factors are notable due to their roles in pathways that play a part in the gross physiological response to burn such as changes in the immune response and inflammation. Conclusion: Our results indicate that our novel selection/classification algorithm has been successful in selecting out genes with play an important role in thermal injury. Additionally, we have demonstrated the value of an integrative approach in identifying possible points of intervention, namely the activation of certain transcription factors that govern the organism's response. © 2007 Yang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: The cell cycle has long been an important model to study the genome-wide transcriptional regulation. Although several methods have been introduced to identify cell cycle regulated genes from microarray data, they can not be directly used to investigate cell cycle regulated transcription factors (CCRTFs), because for many transcription factors (TFs) it is their activities instead of expressions that are periodically regulated across the cell cycle. To overcome this problem, it is useful to infer TF activities across the cell cycle by integrating microarray expression data with ChIP-chip data, and then examine the periodicity of the inferred activities. For most species, however, large-scale ChIP-chip data are still not available. Results: We proposea two-step method to identify the CCRTFs by integrating microarray cell cycle data with ChIP-chip data or motif discovery data. In S. cerevisiae, we identify 42 CCRTFs, among which 23 have been verified experimentally. The cell cycle related behaviors (e.g. at which cell cycle phase a TF achieves the highest activity) predicted by our method are consistent with the well established knowledge about them. We also find that the periodical activity fluctuation of some TFs can be perturbed by the cell synchronization treatment. Moreover, by integrating expression data with in-silico motif discovery data, we identify 8 cell cycle associated regulatory motifs, among which 7 are binding sites for well-known cell cycle related TFs. Conclusion: Our method is effective to identify CCRTFs by integrating microarray cell cycle data with TF-gene binding information. In S. cerevisiae, the TF-gene binding information is provided by the systematic ChIP-chip experiments. In other species where systematic ChIP-chip data is not available, in-silico motif discovery and analysis provide us with an alternative method. Therefore, our method is ready to be implemented to the microarray cell cycle data sets from different species.

The mechanisms which formed the mixed-lithology cycles are still a matter of debate. The mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system discussed in this paper provides a new case study to illustrate the role of orbital forcing in controlling the facies evolution and cyclic stacking of small-scale sequences deposited on the outer sector of a ramp. Two sections are discussed that display mixed siliciclastics and carbonates arranged in upward-shallowing cycles. Each cycle shows an upward decrease in the terrigenous input and a parallel increase in benthic fauna. Time-series analyses indicate the cyclic carbonate-terrigenous pattern to be largely controlled by orbital forcing in the Milankovitch frequency band. Coupling of climate change and sea-level fluctuations in tune with orbital cycles are proposed as driving mechanisms. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Given the recent explosion of interest in streaming data and online algorithms, clustering of time-series subsequences, extracted via a sliding window, has received much attention. In this work, we make a surprising claim. Clustering of time-series subsequences is meaningless. More concretely, clusters extracted from these time series are forced to obey a certain constraint that is pathologically unlikely to be satisfied by any dataset, and because of this, the clusters extracted by any clustering algorithm are essentially random. While this constraint can be intuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and is simple to prove, it has never appeared in the literature. We can justify calling our claim surprising because it invalidates the contribution of dozens of previously published papers. We will justify our claim with a theorem, illustrative examples, and a comprehensive set of experiments on reimplementations of previous work. Although the primary contribution of our work is to draw attention to the fact that an apparent solution to an important problem is incorrect and should no longer be used, we also introduce a novel method that, based on the concept of time-series motifs, is able to meaningfully cluster subsequences on some time-series datasets. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd. 2004.},

This response is carried out by a dynamic network of protein-DNA interactions that allows the specific regulation of genes needed for the response. We have developed a novel computational method that uses an input-output hidden Markov model to model these regulatory networks while taking into account their dynamic nature. Our method works by identifying bifurcation points, places in the time series where the expression of a subset of genes diverges from the rest of the genes. These points are annotated with the transcription factors regulating these transitions resulting in a unified temporal map. Applying our method to study yeast response to stress, we derive dynamic models that are able to recover many of the known aspects of these responses. Predictions made by our method have been experimentally validated leading to new roles for Ino4 and Gcn4 in controlling yeast response to stress. The temporal cascade of factors reveals common pathways and highlights differences between master and secondary factors in the utilization of network motifs and in condition-specific regulation. © 2007 EMBO and Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

The power of the algorithm comes from the fact that it uses a small number of parameters with minimal assumptions regarding the data being examined or the underlying motifs. Our interest lies in applying the algorithm to financial time series data to identify unknown patterns that exist. The algorithm is tested using three separate data sets. Particular suitability to financial data is shown by applying it to oil price data. In all cases, the algorithm identifies the presence of a motif population in a fast and efficient manner due to the utilization of an intuitive symbolic representation. The resulting population of motifs is shown to have considerable potential value for other applications such as forecasting and algorithm seeding. © 2008 Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

In the time series of folding, the denatured proteins undergo a conformational change toward the native state. The model proteins exhibit a variety of kinetic folding pathways that include a fast-track folding pathway without passing through an intermediate and multiple pathways with trapping into more than one intermediate.

The challenge lies in reliably inferring regulatory relationships from datasets that normally possess a large number of genes and a limited number of time points. In addition to the numerical challenge, the enormous complexity and dynamic properties of gene expression regulation also impede the progress of inferring gene regulatory relationships. Based on the accepted model of the relationship between regulator and target genes, we developed a new approach for inferring gene regulatory relationships by combining target-target pattern recognition and examination of regulator-specific binding sites in the promoter regions of putative target genes. Pattern recognition was accomplished in two steps: A first algorithm was used to search for the genes that share expression profile similarities with known target genes (KTGs) of each investigated regulator. The selected genes were further filtered by examining for the presence of regulator-specific binding sites in their promoter regions. As we implemented our approach to 18 yeast regulator genes and their known target genes, we discovered 267 new regulatory relationships, among which 15% are rediscovered, experimentally validated ones. Of the discovered target genes, 36.1% have the same or similar functions to a KTG of the regulator. An even larger number of inferred genes fall in the biological context and regulatory scope of their regulators. Since the regulatory relationships are inferred from pattern recognition between target-target genes, the method we present is especially suitable for inferring gene regulatory relationships in which there is a time delay between the expression of regulating and target genes. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Microarray experimental data are a valuable, but limited source for inferring gene regulation mechanisms on a genomic scale. Additional information such as promoter sequences of genes/DNA binding motifs, gene ontologies, and location data, when combined with gene expression analysis can increase the statistical significance of the finding. This paper introduces a machine learning approach to information fusion for combining heterogeneous genomic data. The algorithm uses an unsupervised joint learning mechanism that identifies clusters of genes using the combined data. Results: The correlation between gene expression time-series patterns obtained from different experimental conditions and the presence of several distinct and repeated motifs in their upstream sequences is examined here using publicly available yeast cell-cycle data. The results show that the combined learning approach taken here identifies correlated genes effectively. The algorithm provides an automated clustering method, but allows the user to specify apriori the influence of each data type on the final clustering using probabilities.

	abstract = {Regulation of gene expression via specific cis-regulatory promoter elements has evolved in cellular organisms as a major adaptive mechanism to respond to environmental change. Assuming a simple model of transcriptional regulation, genes that are differentially expressed in response to a large number of different external stimuli should harbor more distinct regulatory elements in their upstream regions than do genes that only respond to few environmental challenges. We tested this hypothesis in Arabidopsis thaliana using the compendium of gene expression profiling data available in AtGenExpress and known cis-element motifs mapped to upstream gene promoter regions and studied the relation of the observed breadth of differential gene expression response with several fundamental genome architectural properties. We observed highly significant positive correlations between the density of cis-elements in upstream regions and the number of conditions in which a gene was differentially regulated. The correlation was most pronounced in regions immediately upstream of the transcription start sites. Multistimuli response genes were observed to be associated with significantly longer upstream intergenic regions, retain more paralogs in the Arabidopsis genome, are shorter, have fewer introns, and are more likely to contain TATA-box motifs in their promoters. In abiotic stress time series data, multistimuli response genes were found to be overrepresented among early-responding genes. Genes involved in the regulation of transcription, stress response, and signaling processes were observed to possess the greatest regulatory capacity. Our results suggest that greater gene expression regulatory complexity appears to be encoded by an increased density of cis-regulatory elements and provide further evidence for an evolutionary adaptation of the regulatory code at the genomic layout level. Larger intergenic spaces preceding multistimuli response genes may have evolved to allow greater regulatory gene expression potential. © 2007 Walther et al.},

However the development of appropriate feature extraction methods is a tedious effort particularly because every new classification task requires tailoring the feature set anew. This paper presents a unifying framework for feature extraction from value series. Operators of this framework can be combined to feature extraction methods automatically using a genetic programming approach. The construction of features is guided by the performance of the learning classifier which uses the features. Our approach to automatic feature extraction requires a balance between the completeness of the methods on one side and the tractability of searching for appropriate methods on the other side. In this paper some theoretical considerations illustrate the trade-off. After the feature extraction a second process learns a classifier from the transformed data. The practical use of the methods is shown by two types of experiments: classification of genres and classification according to user preferences. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media Inc.},

	abstract = {We present an approach to activity discovery, the unsupervised identification and modeling of human actions embedded in a larger sensor stream. Activity discovery can be seen as the inverse of the activity recognition problem. Rather than learn models from hand-labeled sequences, we attempt to discover motifs, sets of similar subsequences within the raw sensor stream, without the benefit of labels or manual segmentation. These motifs are statistically unlikely and thus typically correspond to important or characteristic actions within the activity. The problem of activity discovery differs from typical motif discovery, such as locating protein binding sites, because of the nature of time series data representing human activity. For example, in activity data, motifs will tend to be sparsely distributed, vary in length, and may only exhibit intra-motif similarity after appropriate time warping. In this paper, we motivate the activity discovery problem and present our approach for efficient discovery of meaningful actions from sensor data representing human activity. We empirically evaluate the approach on an exercise data set captured by a wrist-mounted, three-axis inertial sensor. Our algorithm successfully discovers motifs that correspond to the real exercises with a recall rate of 96.3% and overall accuracy of 86.7% over six exercises and 864 occurrences. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Data visualization techniques are very important for data analysis, since the human eye has been frequently advocated as the ultimate data-mining tool. However, there has been surprisingly little work on visualizing massive time series data sets. To this end, we developed VizTree, a time series pattern discovery and visualization system based on augmenting suffix trees. VizTree visually summarizes both the global and local structures of time series data at the same time. In addition, it provides novel interactive solutions to many pattern discovery problems, including the discovery of frequently occurring patterns (motif discovery), surprising patterns (anomaly detection), and query by content. VizTree works by transforming the time series into a symbolic representation, and encoding the data in a modified suffix tree in which the frequency and other properties of patterns are mapped onto colors and other visual properties. We demonstrate the utility of our system by comparing it with state-of-the-art batch algorithms on several real and synthetic data sets. Based on the tree structure, we further device a coefficient which measures the dissimilarity between any two time series. This coefficient is shown to be competitive with the well-known Euclidean distance. © 2005, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Genome sequencing projects and high-throughput technologies like DNA and Protein arrays have resulted in a very large amount of information-rich data. Microarray experimental data are a valuable, but limited source for inferring gene regulation mechanisms on a genomic scale. Additional information such as promoter sequences of genes/ DNA binding motifs, gene ontologies, and location data, when combined with gene expression analysis can increase the statistical significance of the finding. This paper introduces a machine learning approach to information fusion for combining heterogeneous genomic data. This algorithm uses an unsupervised joint learning mechanism that identifies clusters of genes using the combined data. The correlation between gene expression time-series patterns obtained from different experimental conditions and the presence of several distinct and repeated motifs in their upstream sequences is examined here using publicly available yeast cell-cycle data. The results show that the combined learning approach taken here identifies correlated genes effectively. The algorithm provides an automated clustering method, but allows the user to specify apriori the influence of each data type on the final clustering using probabilities.},

An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful as a tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition it could be used as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks, including the discovery of association rules, clustering and classification.

	abstract = {The emergence of drug-resistant virus in hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients treated with lamivudine is well documented. In this study, we determined the mutations occurring in the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) amino acid motif of the HBV DNA polymerase gene, as well as upstream and downstream of this region, in patients with breakthrough virus during lamivudine therapy. Thirty-one Turkish patients (20 patients HBeAg positive, 11 patients HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive) with chronic HBV infection who completed at least 104 weeks of lamivudine treatment were investigated. All patients received lamivudine, (150 mg/day), for 104 weeks, with or without 4 months of interferon (IFN) combination. HBV-specific sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from sera of patients with breakthrough virus, and the PCR products were directly analysed by sequencing. Breakthrough virus was detected in seven of the 31 patients (22.6%) between 9 and 18 months of therapy. Of the seven patients, six were HBeAg positive at baseline, and four had a double mutation consisting of rtM204V and rtL180M, while two had an rtM204I change. In one patient, two base substitutions at rt204 (ATG → AGT:T to G and G to T) lead to a methionine to serine change (YMDD → YSDD). This novel DNA pol mutation was detected at month 18 of lamivudine treatment. In addition, this new variant had the rtL180M mutation and a 12 base pair deletion in the pre-S1 region between nucleotides 43-54. The YSDD mutation was still present 6 months after lamivudine discontinuation. In vitro transfection studies also confirmed that the YSDD strain is resistant to lamivudine, In conclusion, the results indicate that, in addition to a Met → Val and Met → Ile change in YMDD. a Met → Ser change at rt204 (YMDD → YSDD) associated with the rtL180M change can also emerge during lamivudine treatment, which confers lamivudine resistance in vivo and in vitro, leading to virological breakthrough and ALT increases.},

In this paper we present the Motif Tracking Algorithm, a novel immune inspired pattern identification tool that is able to identify unknown motifs which repeat within time series data. The power of the algorithm is derived from its use of a small number of parameters with minimal assumptions. The algorithm searches from a completely neutral perspective that is independent of the data being analysed and the underlying motifs. In this paper the motif tracking algorithm is applied to the search for patterns within sequences of low level system calls between the Linux kernel and the operating system's user space. The MTA is able to compress data found in large system call data sets to a limited number of motifs which summarise that data. The motifs provide a resource from which a profile of executed processes can be built. The potential for these profiles and new implications for security research are highlighted. A higher level system call language for measuring similarity between patterns of such calls is also suggested. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	abstract = {Our goal is to cluster genes into transcriptional modules - sets of genes where similarity in expression is explained by common regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional level. We want to learn modules from both time series gene expression data and genome-wide motif data that are now readily available for organisms such as S. cereviseae as a result of prior computational studies or experimental results. We present a generative probabilistic model for combining regulatory sequence and time series expression data to cluster genes into coherent transcriptional modules. Starting with a set of motifs representing known or putative regulatory elements (transcription factor binding sites) and the counts of occurrences of these motifs in each gene's promoter region, together with a time series expression profile for each gene, the learning algorithm uses expectation maximization to learn module assignments based on both types of data. We also present a technique based on the Jensen-Shannon entropy contributions of motifs in the learned model for associating the most significant motifs to each module. Thus, the algorithm gives a global approach for associating sets of regulatory elements to "modules" of genes with similar time series expression profiles. The model for expression data exploits our prior belief of smooth dependence on time by using statistical splines and is suitable for typical time course data sets with relatively few experiments. Moreover, the model is sufficiently interpretable that we can understand how both sequence data and expression data contribute to the cluster assignments, and how to interpolate between the two data sources.

	abstract = {The problem of locating motifs in real-valued, multivariate time series data involves the discovery of sets of recurring patterns embedded in the time series. Each set is composed of several non-overlapping subsequences and constitutes a motif because all of the included subsequences are similar. The ability to automatically discover such motifs allows intelligent systems to form endogenously meaningful representations of their environment through unsupervised sensor analysis. In this paper, we formulate a unifying view of motif discovery as a problem of locating regions of high density in the space of all time series subsequences. Our approach is efficient (sub-quadratic in the length of the data), requires fewer user-specified parameters than previous methods, and naturally allows variable length motif occurrences and nonlinear temporal warping. We evaluate the performance of our approach using four data sets from different domains including on-body inertial sensors and speech.

	abstract = {There have been a number of revolutions in molecular biology in the past few decades, especially, the completion of immense effort to sequence the human genome.1,2 Most recently, gene-expression profiling and proteomics studies has become revolutionizing biology.3-5 These high-throughput methodologies generate experimental data at rates that exceed knowledge growth. A major challenge for researchers is to make biological sense out of the large amounts of information proceeding from these experiments. The interpretation of these experiments can be facilitated by well-presented functional annotations, which provide an overview of the functions that predominate in functional annotations for each gene and protein. Searching gene and protein functions is very useful and important in investigating the relationship between these significant gene expression, biological categories, and experimental clusters. Therefore, for the purpose, we have developed a public available software tool Bulk Gene Search System for Java, BGSSJ. It will save time and enhance the ability to analyze gene expression and proteomics data; furthermore, it can be used to project these data into functional units and also served to compare the significant of different experimental methods. We present our new developed public available software tool Bulk Gene Search System for Java (BGSSJ) which is an XML-based Java application. The program enables the functional annotation (classification) and description of genes or proteins from any organism. It will save time and enhance the ability to analyze gene expression and proteomics data, also already delivers extremely useful information and resources to the life science. Now, it is available at http://bgssj.sourceforge.net/. Inferring genetic network architecture from time series data generated from high-throughput experimental technologies, such as cDNA microarray, can help us to understand the system behavior of living organisms. We have developed an interactive tool, GeneNetwork6, which provides four reverse engineering models and three data interpolation approaches to infer relationships between genes. GeneNetwork enables a user to readily reconstruct genetic networks based on microarray data without having intimate knowledge of the mathematical models. A simple graphical user interface enables rapid, intuitive mapping and analysis of the reconstructed network allowing biologists to explore gene relationships at the system level. In studies of cancer research including cell adhesion, migration, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, synthetic peptides containing the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif have been extensively used as the inhibitors of integrin-ligand interactions. We designed a cyclic-RGD peptide (Tpa-RGDWPC, cRGD) with rigid skeleton to closely bind with its receptor. We showed that the cRGD exerts more potency than linear RGD on inhibiting cell growth of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. This stimulated us to question how cRGD inhibits cell growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Moreover, understanding what molecular mechanism underlies the RGD motif exerting in MCF-7 cells is also of considerable importance. Summarily, in this study, we used two high-throughput techniques, DNA microarray and proteomics, to survey the global changes in genes and proteins after cyclic-RGD peptides treatment on MCF-7 cancer cells. Furthermore, we annotated these gene functions and constructed the gene network using our developed software, BGSSJ and GeneNetwork, respectively. These results provide a molecular explanation for the properties of cRGD in breast cancer cells and put forth a valuable in-depth impact in breast cancer therapy. © 2005 IEEE.},

We examined the time series of the distance between the glycosidic nitrogen atoms, root-mean-square deviations from A-DNA and B-DNA, various backbone and glycosidic torsion angles, and the pseudorotation phase angles as functions of the simulation time step. All these time series imply that the present simulation has indeed sampled a very wide conformational space. The results for the backbone and glycosidic torsion angles and pseudorotation phase angles imply that B-DNA structures are the dominant motif of the stacked dimers, while a small population of A-DNA also exists in the stacked states. © World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We designed cyclic-RGD peptide (Tpa-RGDWPC-, cRGD) which could cause cell death in MCF-7 cell line. In order to understand the mechanism involved in cRGD-induced apoptosis, we used microarray, real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) and bioinformatics to study the effects of cRGD on breast cancer cell line MCF-7. By time-series gene expression measurements and our developed software BSIP and GeneNetwork, we reconstructed an apoptosis-related gene network. In the network, caspase-9, located at the upstream, activates downstream effector caspases such as caspase-7, leading to the induction of caspase-4. Combined our previous proteomics data with newly performed docking simulation, it indicated that the cell death induced by cRGD may be triggered through blocking integrin signaling to the extracellular matrix and activation of caspase pathway. This study provides a molecular explanation of cRGD treatment in breast cancer cells and set forth a constructive far-reaching impact on breast cancer therapy. © 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

	abstract = {Here we present a novel algorithm, GeMoDA (Generic Motif Discovery Algorithm), for discovering repeated patterns in real-valued, sequential data without requiring alignment or pattern enumeration. GeMoDA is closely related to the Teiresias algorithm, but borrows new concepts from frequent itemset mining and graph theory to extend its capabilities. GeMoDA is generic in the sense that it is applicable to almost any type of sequential data, e.g. DNA/protein sequences, protein structures, and time series data. Given a user-defined notion of similarity and identity, GeMoDA deterministically enumerates all repeated patterns of a minimum length and support. In the context of DNA sequences, for example, similarity may be the Hamming distance between two subsequences. These two subsequences may be considered identical if they have at least 5 bases in common over a window of 10. Given such a problem statement, GeMoDA will find all patterns that occur at least k times and are of at least size 1-where k and 1 are user inputs - such that all the patterns are maximal in both support and length. These patterns can be modeled using any number of motif representations including position-weight matrices, hidden Markov models, and regular expressions. We show applications of GeMoDA in three domains: protein and DNA sequence motif discovery, and the discovery of repeated substructure discovery in protein structures. Unlike other algorithms for these two applications - viz. Gibbs sampler, MEME, Dali, and others - GeMoDA's output is guaranteed to be both optimal and exhaustive.},

	abstract = {Background: The regulation of genes in multicellular organisms is generally achieved through the combinatorial activity of different transcription factors. However, the quantitative mechanisms of how a combination of transcription factors controls the expression of their target genes remain unknown. Results: By using the information on the yeast transcription network and high-resolution time-series data, the combinatorial expression profiles of regulators that best correlate with the expression of their target genes are identified. We demonstrate that a number of factors, particularly time-shifts among the different regulators as well as conversion efficiencies of transcription factor mRNAs into functional binding regulators, play a key role in the quantification of target gene expression. By quantifying and integrating these factors, we have found a highly significant correlation between the combinatorial time-series expression profile of regulators and their target gene expression in 67.1% of the 161 known yeast three-regulator motifs and in 32.9% of 544 two-regulator motifs. For network motifs involved in the cell cycle, these percentages are much higher. Furthermore, the results have been verified with a high consistency in a second independent set of time-series data. Additional support comes from the finding that a high percentage of motifs again show a significant correlation in time-series data from stress-response studies. Conclusion: Our data strongly support the concept that dynamic cumulative regulation is a major principle of quantitative transcriptional control. The proposed concept might also apply to other organisms and could be relevant for a wide range of biotechnological applications in which quantitative gene regulation plays a role. © 2007 He et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Methods and Results - Through differential-display analysis, we have identified a novel gene whose expression was increased after catheter injury of rabbit aorta. The gene that is expressed predominantly in vascular smooth muscle cells encodes a novel protein with 7 transmembrane domains, and we termed it ITR (intimal thickness-related receptor). The ITR sequence contains a motif common to the Rhodopsin-like GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor) superfamily. In vivo analyses of this gene revealed that expression of ITR protein increased with intimal thickening induced by cuff placement around murine femoral artery. Furthermore, ITR-knockout mice were found to be resistant to this experimental intimal thickening. Conclusions - ITR thus seems to be a novel receptor that may play a role in vascular remodeling and that may represent a good target for development of drugs in the prevention of vascular restenosis.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of global gene expression profiling to identify sets of genes with similar expression patterns is rapidly becoming a widespread approach for understanding biological processes. A logical and systematic approach to study co-expressed genes is to analyze their promoter sequences to identify transcription factors that may be involved in establishing specific profiles and that may be experimentally investigated. Results: We introduce promoter clustering i.e. grouping of promoters with respect to their high scoring motif content, and show that this approach greatly enhances the identification of common and significant transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in co-expressed genes. We apply this method to two different dataset, one consisting of micro array data from 108 leukemias (AMLS) and a second from a time series experiment, and show that biologically relevant promoter patterns may be obtained using phylogenetic foot-printing methodology. In addition, we also found that 15% of the analyzed promoter regions contained transcription factors start sites for additional genes transcribed in the opposite direction. Conclusion: Promoter clustering based on global promoter features greatly improve the identification of shared TFBS in co-expressed genes. We believe that the outlined approach may be a useful first step to identify transcription factors that contribute to specific features of gene expression profiles. © 2006 Veerla and Höglund; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

First, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Second, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. In this work we formulate a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. In particular, we will demonstrate the utility of our representation on various data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content, anomaly detection, motif discovery, and visualization. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {The problem of discovering previously unknown frequent patterns in time series, also called motifs, has been recently introduced. A motif is a subseries pattern that appears a significant number of times. Results demonstrate that motifs may provide valuable insights about the data and have a wide range of applications in data mining tasks. The main motivation for this study was the need to mine time series data from protein folding/unfolding simulations. We propose an algorithm that extracts approximate motifs, i.e. motifs that capture portions of time series with a similar and eventually symmetric behavior. Preliminary results on the analysis of protein unfolding data support this proposal as a valuable tool. Additional experiments demonstrate that the application of utility of our algorithm is not limited to this particular problem. Rather it can be an interesting tool to be applied in many real world problems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

	abstract = {Several important time series data mining problems reduce to the core task of finding approximately repeated subsequences in a longer time series. In an earlier work, we formalized the idea of approximately repeated subsequences by introducing the notion of time series motifs. Two limitations of this work were the poor scalability of the motif discovery algorithm, and the inability to discover motifs in the presence of noise.Here we address these limitations by introducing a novel algorithm inspired by recent advances in the problem of pattern discovery in biosequences. Our algorithm is probabilistic in nature, but as we show empirically and theoretically, it can find time series motifs with very high probability even in the presence of noise or "don't care" symbols. Not only is the algorithm fast, but it is an anytime algorithm, producing likely candidate motifs almost immediately, and gradually improving the quality of results over time. Copyright 2003 ACM.},

	abstract = {We apply an information-theoretic treatment of action potential time series measured with microelectrode arrays to estimate the connectivity of mammalian neuronal cell assemblies grown in vitro. We infer connectivity between two neurons via the measurement of the mutual information between their spike trains. In addition we measure higher-point multi-information between any two spike trains, conditional on the activity of a third cell, as a means to identify and distinguish classes of functional connectivity among three neurons. The use of a conditional three-cell measure removes some interpretational shortcomings of the pairwise mutual information and sheds light on the functional connectivity arrangements of any three cells. We analyze the resultant connectivity graphs in light of other complex networks and demonstrate that, despite their ex vivo development, the connectivity maps derived from cultured neural assemblies are similar to other biological networks and display nontrivial structure in clustering coefficient, network diameter, and assortative mixing. Specifically we show that these networks are weakly disassortative small-world graphs, which differ significantly in their structure from randomized graphs with the same degree. We expect our analysis to be useful in identifying the computational motifs of a wide variety of complex networks, derived from time series data. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Carbon catabolite control protein A (CcpA) is the main regulator involved in carbon catabolite repression in gram-positive bacteria. Time series gene expression analyses of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and L. lactis MG1363ΔccpA using DNA microarrays were used to define the CcpA regulon of L. lactis. Based on a comparison of the transcriptome data with putative CcpA binding motifs (cre sites) in promoter sequences in the genome of L. lactis, 82 direct targets of CcpA were predicted. The main differences in time-dependent expression of CcpA-regulated genes were differences between the exponential and transition growth phases. Large effects were observed for carbon and nitrogen metabolic genes in the exponential growth phase. Effects on nucleotide metabolism genes were observed primarily in the transition phase. Analysis of the positions of putative cre sites revealed that there is a link between either repression or activation and the location of the cre site within the promoter region. Activation was observed when putative cre sites were located upstream of the hexameric -35 sequence at an average position of -56.5 or further upstream with decrements of 10.5 bp. Repression was observed when the cre site was located in or downstream of putative -35 and -10 sequences. The highest level of repression was observed when the cre site was present at a defined side of the DNA helix relative to the canonical -10 sequence. Gel retardation experiments, Northern blotting, and enzyme assays showed that CcpA represses its own expression and activates the expression of the divergently oriented prolidase-encoding pepQ gene, which constitutes a link between regulation of carbon metabolism and regulation of nitrogen metabolism.

In ts ET24 cells, total protein synthesis was not reduced at 39.5°C for 24 h, while mRNA accumulated in the nucleus after incubation at 39.5°C for 17 h. The amount of cyclin A mRNA decreased in ts ET24 cells within 4 h after the temperature shift to 39.5°C, consistent with the fact that the entry into the S-phase was delayed by the temperature shift.},

	abstract = {Background: A number of publications have recently examined the occurrence and properties of the feed-forward motif in a variety of networks, including those that are of interest in genome biology, such as gene networks. The present work looks in some detail at the dynamics of the bifan motif, using systems of ordinary differential equations to model the populations of transcription factors, mRNA and protein, with the aim of extending our understanding of what appear to be important building blocks of gene network structure. Results: We develop an ordinary differential equation model of the bi-fan motif and analyse variants of the motif corresponding to its behaviour under various conditions. In particular, we examine the effects of different steady and pulsed inputs to five variants of the bifan motif, based on evidence in the literature of bifan motifs found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (commonly known as baker's yeast). Using this model, we characterize the dynamical behaviour of the bi-fan motif for a wide range of biologically plausible parameters and configurations. We find that there is no characteristic behaviour for the motif, and with the correct choice of parameters and of internal structure, very different, indeed even opposite behaviours may be obtained. Conclusion: Even with this relatively simple model, the bi-fan motif can exhibit a wide range of dynamical responses. This suggests that it is difficult to gain significant insights into biological function simply by considering the connection architecture of a gene network, or its decomposition into simple structural motifs. It is necessary to supplement such structural information by kinetic parameters, or dynamic time series experimental data, both of which are currently difficult to obtain. © 2006 Ingram et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},
